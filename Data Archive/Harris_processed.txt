economic progress at the start of the biden harris administration  in the midst of the worst economic crisis in     years  experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession 
 but democrats chose to put workers first  and instead of recession  america has seen remarkable strength and resilience 
  percent last year the fastest rate of any major economy in the world 
 while too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store  or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills  were making progress 
 wages are rising faster than prices  and inflation today is down nearly two thirds from its peak 
 democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices 
 and well keep investing in american workers  american jobs  and american families  bringing factories home to win the race for the future 
 democrats know the story of the middle class isnt separate from the state of the economy its at its heart 
 and well never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal 
 investing in america infrastructure the bipartisan infrastructure law is breaking ground on over        projects across       communities nationwide 
 were rebuilding major roadways  from the blatnik bridge  a vital link between wisconsin and minnesota that carries more    billion in goods a year through the largest great lakes port  to a key stretch of the i    outside phoenix that sees         vehicles a day 
 were making the biggest investment in public transit in history  and at last building americas first true high speed rail lines 
 were replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a decade  so every child can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water without risking cancer or brain damage 
 weve added over        megawatts of new clean power capacity  the equivalent of building    hoover dams  to help shrink energy costs and meet ambitious climate goals 
 and were bringing affordable  reliable  high speed internet to every american household 
 high speed internet is as vital to our economy today as electricity first was a century ago  americans need it to do their jobs  to do their homework  to access health care  and to stay connected 
 but a full    million of us still live in areas where there is no high speed internet 
 these projects dont just build infrastructure  they create hundreds of thousands of good jobs for american workers 
 manufacturing democrats are also taking historic steps to bring home critical supply chains  and to reaffirm our nations leadership in cutting edge industries that america in fact often pioneered 
 after the pandemic exposed our reliance on foreign made semiconductors  we passed the chips and science act  to restore americas role producing the tiny computer chips needed to make everything from cell phones to dishwashers to cars 
 and as the climate crisis makes the shift to clean energy more urgent  we passed the inflation reduction act  making the worlds biggest investment ever in building renewable energy  electric vehicles  and other green technologies here at home 
 under president biden  weve also boosted funding for the kind of research and development that can seed economy transforming breakthroughs  like the internet 
 in recent years  america became one of the worlds only major countries to pull back on r d investments  democrats are changing that 
 president biden for example launched the advanced research projects agency for health  arpa h  in       to find game changing medical cures and treatments and transform important areas of medicine 
 under his leadership  well continue supporting nasa and americas presence on the international space station  and working to send americans back to the moon and to mars 
 democrats will keep america at the forefront of scientific discovery and innovation  responsibly leading the way in the defining fields of the future  like ai  biotech  quantum computing  advanced materials  and more 
 good jobs president biden believes that you shouldnt have to go to a four year college to live a good  middle class life 
 democrats are working to make sure that every american can access these quality new jobs  where many people can earn over          a year 
 the american rescue plan supported more than       state  and local government workforce development programs  while our investing in american agenda is expanding job training partnerships between high schools  community colleges  unions  and employers 
 we have a million trainees enrolled in registered apprenticeships today 
 apprenticeships have long provided a reliable path to the middle class  empowering workers to earn while they learn  not only in traditional trades  but also in new cutting edge industries 
 extreme republicans have proposed gutting funding for registered apprenticeships in this years budget 
 well keep making historic investments in them to keep expanding opportunity  including by partnering directly with unions 
 democrats know that wall street didnt build america 
 the middle class built america and unions built the middle class 
 president biden and vice president harris are proud to lead the most pro union administration in history 
 president biden named staunch labor allies and former union leaders to positions across the government  and empowered them to fight for good jobs and workers rights 
 biden is the first president to walk a picket line  joining uaw workers on strike in detroit before they won historic wage increases last year 
 he knows that when unions win  all workers benefit  and as we rebuild our economy for the future  every worker needs a voice and a fair shot 
 democrats will keep fighting to pass the protecting the right to organize  pro  act  to give everyone the right to organize for better pay  benefits  and working conditions  and to hold abusive bosses accountable for violating workers rights 
 we oppose state right to work laws  which drive down wages and leave workers unsafe  and we support penalizing employers who engage in union busting 
 well work to pass the public service freedom to negotiate act  guaranteeing public sector bargaining rights  and to codify a right to organize for domestic workers  farm workers  and other unprotected laborers 
 democrats will continue to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars through legislation and with strong buy american rules 
 consistent with the law  we will ensure that federal grants and other assistance to employers are contingent on recipients committing to not interfering with workers efforts to form a union 
 by leveraging the benefits of federal grants for infrastructure  manufacturing and services  we will seek to ensure that all americans have the opportunity to participate in the american dream 
 well strengthen enforcement and penalties for safety  wage  and other labor and employment violations 
 and  democrats will continue to aggressively hold companies accountable for violating child labor law 
 weve increased funding for the occupational safety and health administration to protect workers on the job  and well continue to support workplace whistleblowers 
 at the same time  were pushing to guarantee workers the pay  benefits  and protections they deserve as well 
 we passed the butch lewis act  keeping over   million peoples hard earned pensions solvent 
 we also raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to     
   an hour  and will keep pushing congress to increase it to at least     for all americans 
 were making millions more hourly workers eligible for overtime pay  and weve cracked down on wage theft and exploitation  recovering over      million for low wage workers wrongly denied pay 
 were making it harder for employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors to avoid paying them full pay and benefits 
 were banning most non compete agreements  freeing workers to move between jobs and negotiate 
 and weve restricted mandatory arbitration  so fewer employers can silence wronged employees in a workplace dispute 
 postal service is the worlds most efficient  and democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public u 
 we will fight all efforts to privatize it and will work to ensure that its financially sustainable 
 we will protect its universal service obligation and on time delivery 
 and we will support a board of governors and a postal regulatory commission that champion a strong public postal service 
 we fought hard to pass the most significant investments in america in generations 
 now  well continue the important work of implementing them  to be sure that the benefits are shared in every corner of america and create good paying jobs that folks can raise a family on  with the chance to join a union  and that rely on materials made here at home 
 we have to own these industries and jobs of the future 
 small businesses small businesses are the engine of americas economy and the glue of our communities 
 they employ nearly half of all private sector workers  and drive half of all economic activity 
 they embody the vision and grit that literally built this country 
 since then  democrats have passed other historic laws  to build infrastructure  semiconductors  clean energy  and the small business supply chains that support those cutting edge industries  here at home 
 the administration is expanding access to capital  business opportunities  and training to help those small businesses  while working for a fairer tax code  to level the playing field for small entrepreneurs who have to compete against corporate giants 
 the administration has invested a record     billion in community development finance institutions  cdfis   to support small businesses and growth across low income communities 
 the small business administration is nearly halfway to its goal of providing      billion in financing to         small businesses by      
 for example  to get mom and pop businesses the small loans  under           that are often hard to secure  the sba has brought in additional non traditional lenders that specialize in working with underserved small businesses 
 its now on track to double these loans by years end  compared to      
 the administration is also directing billions of dollars to community lenders and state level small business programs 
 along with initiatives like vice president harriss economic opportunity coalition  it is mobilizing hundreds of billions more in private investment 
 at the same time  the federal government this year set a record for small business contract spending  awarding them    percent of total procurement dollars  directly supporting a million jobs 
 it is on track to meet its goal of increasing federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by    percent 
 as a result  america is today in the midst of a historic small business boom 
 a record    million new business applications have been filed since joe biden became president the three strongest years of new business growth in history  and over    percent faster than pre pandemic averages 
 since the pandemic  the share of black households owning a business has more than doubled  latino business ownership is up    percent  and women own a record share of businesses 
 as president biden often says  each new business formed is an act of hope 
 thanks to president bidens bipartisan infrastructure law  the minority business development agency is now a permanent part of the commerce department  where its training underserved entrepreneurs 
 the sbas innovative community navigators program meanwhile helped         small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow 
 in a second biden term  well make that navigator program permanent  and include new lenders  new markets  and fairer taxes 
 agriculture american farmers are the backbone of our country 
 but over the years  trickle down economics has hit rural america hard 
 farming costs have gone up and incomes have gone down 
 big agriculture moved in  telling too many small farms that the surest path to success was to get big or get out 
 as a result  we lost over         farms in america in the last    years  and rural communities have paid a steep price 
 too many young people have had to leave their hometowns to find good paying work and a shot at their dreams 
 the president believes that no one should have to leave the community where they grew up just to find opportunity 
 his investing in america agenda is investing in all of america  including farms and rural areas 
 its creating new sources of income for farmers and increasing competition among suppliers  to both lower the cost of farm inputs and to get small and mid size farmers a larger share of profits 
 the inflation reduction act is helping farmers and ranchers adopt climate smart practices  which make the land more resilient and increase profitability  while connecting them to new markets and premiums for sustainably produced commodities 
 the administration recognizes the critical role that our land stewards play in our food systems  economy  and environment  and is working hard to drive both public and private funds to reward these champions for nature for their hard work 
 the administration has also supported independent meat and poultry processing  reducing producers reliance on big companies to buy their product  and its working to make livestock and poultry markets fairer and more transparent 
 today  family farms have more income from more varied sources  so their children have more opportunity to stay family farmers 
 at the same time  the administration is helping family farmers service distressed loans in order to keep their lands and ultimately pass them down to their kids 
 it has worked with many farmers to boost the production of expensive fertilizer  increasing supply and easing costs for everyone else 
 also expanded farm insurance to allow for more double cropping  a practice that increases farm earnings  expands the food supply  and helps lower average food prices for american families 
 going forward  democrats will also work to get farmers the right to repair their own equipment  without having to pay big equipment makers for diagnostic tools and repairs 
 and we will look to further limit foreign ownership of u 
 farmland to protect our food supply and national security 
 throughout  democrats have stood by farm workers 
 we are working to improve workers safety at meat processing facilities  and we will continue to enforce and advance labor and environmental rules  for example promoting organizing rights and requiring overtime pay  and boosting protections against harmful pesticides and extreme heat 
 fighting poverty as democrats  we believe in an america where people look out for one another and leave no one behind 
 but we know we still have a long way to go to make americas promise real for everyone 
 the pandemic made things worse  hitting the poor hardest  and pushing millions more families to the brink 
 the american rescue plan drove poverty to record lows in      
 it expanded the child tax credit and made it available to all low income children for the first time  helping to slash child poverty by nearly half 
 it tripled the maximum earned income tax credit for millions of low income workers  so their taxes wouldnt push them deeper into poverty 
 it kept   million families in their homes  child care centers open  and small businesses on their feet 
 it increased supplemental nutrition assistance program  snap  benefits  helping tens of millions of americans keep food on the table 
 democrats know that most folks fundamentally want the same things not a hand out  but a fair shot 
 thats why well keep pushing to restore the expanded child tax credit and earned income tax credit  which proved so effective at reducing poverty before republicans let them expire 
 well work to finally raise the federal minimum wage to at least     an hour 
 well fight for paid leave  better health care  and more investment in public schools and affordable housing 
 well reduce the need for foster care  by supporting families and engaging kin 
 well further expand public transit  connecting communities that have been cut off for too long 
 well keep working to get more low income families access to affordable banking as well  and to boost the supply of capital and loans by investing more in cdfis 
 well also push to make the new markets tax credit permanent  drawing new investment to low income communities nationwide 
 and well continue to reject republican proposals to increase poverty by making devastating cuts to programs that vulnerable americans count on 
 in the wealthiest nation on earth  we all benefit when we help one another 
 democrats will keep working to build an economy that rewards work  not wealth  where we care for the most vulnerable  and unleash the potential that all our children have to grow and thrive 
 we remain committed to fighting poverty and enabling all americans to live up to their god given potential 
 ending special interest giveaways to invest in the american people and reduce the deficit  democrats are also ending giveaways to big corporations and special interests that have benefitted at the expense of american taxpayers for too long 
 were seizing a tremendous opportunity for savings on prescription drugs and insurance 
 the administration has already cracked down on one of big pharmas biggest scams  by finally giving medicare  the single biggest buyer of drugs in america  the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices  as the va and private insurers have done for years 
 the administration is also requiring drugmakers to reimburse medicare if they hike prices faster than inflation 
 that kind of markup pads big pharma profits  wasting taxpayer dollars 
 democrats will expand the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the inflation reduction act  saving taxpayers nearly      billion over the next    years  as medicare will no longer have to pay big pharma exorbitant prices 
 at the same time  well keep pushing to crack down on outsize insurance company profits  for example by requiring health insurers to reimburse medicaid if they bill more than they actually spend on patient care 
 we also believe in saving taxpayers money by investing more in preventative health care  vaccines  and other treatment for medicaid and chip beneficiaries  avoiding unnecessary medical costs by keeping folks healthy investing in america  and in the american people 
 chapter two  rewarding work  not wealth to any american with the ingenuity and drive to make a million bucks  president biden says  great 
 a hedge fund manager or ceo should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter 
 a company with billions of dollars in profits should not pay    in taxes 
 a fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make our nation strong  like health care  education  a clean environment  and the national defense 
 its how we protect programs that americans rely on  like social security and medicare 
 its how we build a powerful economy  reduce fiscal risks  and lead the world 
 we dont believe we should add    trillion to the national debt to give more tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations 
 were fighting to reward work  not wealth to cut costs and make the tax code fairer for the middle class  while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share 
 under president bidens plan  no american earning less than          a year will pay one single penny more in federal taxes  period 
 were working to end special interest giveaways  and to make sure all americans play by the same rules 
 and instead of exploding the national deficit  our plan cuts it by    trillion over the next decade  delivering real results for the american people in a fiscally responsible way 
 cutting taxes for working families democrats will protect everyone earning less than          a year from any tax increase  and we will fight to protect and expand other tax benefits for working people and families with children 
 during the pandemic  democrats expanded the child tax credit  saving nearly    million families with    million children up to        per child per year  and cutting child poverty nearly in half to its lowest rate on record 
 we expanded the earned income tax credit as well  saving over    million low paid workers an average      a year 
 and  we expanded the health insurance premium tax credit  saving millions of families who buy coverage on an affordable care act exchange about      a year 
 republicans are opposed to this tax relief for families that need it 
 they already blocked renewal of our child tax credit and earned income tax credit expansions  pushing   million children back into poverty 
 republicans also keep trying to repeal our premium tax credit expansions  which will raise health care costs for millions of families 
 democrats will keep fighting to restore and protect that tax relief  giving tens of millions of families some breathing room again 
 and president biden has also proposed a         tax credit for first time homebuyers and people selling their first homes  to help reduce housing costs for working families 
 the treasury department and the irs are also making it easier and cheaper for americans to file their taxes and collect the refunds theyre owed 
 the irs successfully piloted a free  easy to use online tool  direct file  which has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars in filing fees 
 it has since announced that direct file will be a permanent offering  saving users an average      in filing costs but republicans keep trying to defund this free tool 
 making the wealthy   big corporations pay their fair share president bidens plans will cut taxes for middle class and low income americans and well finance those cuts by making the ultra wealthy and big corporations finally start paying their fair share 
 there are a thousand billionaires in america  and they pay an average   percent in taxes a far lower rate than a firefighter or teacher 
 democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax rate of    percent  raising      billion in    years 
 well end the preferential treatment for capital gains for millionaires  so they pay the same rate on investment income as on wages 
 well put an end to abusive life insurance tax shelters  and stop billionaires from exploiting retirement tax incentives that are supposed to help middle class families save 
 well eliminate the  stepped up basis  loophole for the wealthiest americans  so they cant avoid paying taxes on their wealth by passing it down to heirs 
 democrats will close the  carried interest  loophole  which wealthy fund managers have long used to halve tax rates on their own personal pay  so they pay a lower rate than some teachers or firefighters do 
 and  well increase our new stock buyback tax to   percent to discourage stock buybacks that benefit executives and wealthy shareholders  instead of workers and consumers 
 we will also keep upping the pressure on wealthy and corporate tax cheats that fail to pay what they owe 
 the irs was severely underfunded for years  but democrats are improving irs services for everyday taxpayers and reviving enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats  raising more than an estimated      billion in additional revenue as a result 
 the irs has already collected over      million in unpaid taxes from less than       delinquent millionaires  and launched efforts aimed at thousands of other millionaires who hadnt filed a return in years 
 democrats will protect this progress by continuing to invest in modernizing the irs 
 republicans are working to reverse it  protecting wealthy tax cheats and increasing the deficit instead 
 democrats will also make billion dollar companies pay their fair share 
 in          of the biggest companies in america made     billion in profit  but paid zero in federal income taxes 
 democrats oppose unfair loopholes and wasteful subsidies that benefit special interests at everyone elses expense 
 that starts by eliminating tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for oil and gas companies 
 it means ending special tax breaks for corporate jets  and boosting fuel taxes on corporate and private jet travel  saving taxpayers    billion over    years 
 and well no longer permit companies to deduct the cost of paying executives more than    million a year 
 corporations shouldnt get a tax break for giving huge pay packages to ceos 
 chapter three  lowering costs today  our economy is growing  wages are rising  and a record number of americans have good jobs 
 but for too many hard working families  the cost of living is too high 
 lowering costs is democrats number one economic priority 
 were using every tool to bring prices down on health insurance and prescription drugs  including negotiating the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure  and on housing  child care  internet  banking  credit cards  and more 
 we have more to do  but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in peoples pockets 
 those savings add up  and democrats will keep fighting until every american feels them 
 when the pandemic disrupted supply chains  everyday items became hard to get  raising prices 
 when russia invaded ukraine  food and gas prices spiked more 
 as companies costs went up  they raised prices  too 
 president biden worked across industries to ease supply bottlenecks and get goods and energy flowing again 
 he delivered  and inflation has since dropped two thirds from its peak 
 but some companies havent passed those new savings on to consumers 
 their costs have come down  but theyve kept prices high anyway  boosting profits 
 corporate profits have more than doubled since      
 last year  after tax profit ratios for corporations outside the financial sector were their highest in    years 
 president bidens lowering costs agenda is historic in scope  attacking the issue from every angle to help cut costs for consumers  crack down on price gouging  and get companies to use their record profits to reduce prices long term 
 its also investing in making things in america again to boost supply  push down prices  and bring jobs home 
 health care   prescription drugs health care today  more americans have health insurance than ever in history 
 a record    million people signed up through the affordable care act this year  helping to slash the uninsured rate from    percent in      to under   percent now 
 democrats have expanded the health insurance premium tax credit twice  saving millions of americans an average of      a year on coverage  and helping an additional   
  million latinos          black americans  and         asian americans buy more affordable insurance 
 republicans want to let those credits expire  increasing premiums 
 as democrats  we support medicaid expansion  encouraging states to provide health coverage to low income americans on the federal governments tab 
 the administration has helped over a million people in four states to enroll  and well keep pushing congress to further expand medicaid like coverage to the   
  million uninsured low income adults who live in states where republicans still refuse the help 
 democrats are working to protect kids health coverage as well  by removing financial barriers for the childrens health insurance program  and making it easier for families to keep kids on medicaid 
 president bidens plan will let families go three years without having to resubmit medicaid paperwork for children younger than six  reducing burdensome red tape 
 democrats believe that quality  affordable health care should be available in every corner of america 
 the administration has invested in new mobile health clinics  and in keeping community and rural health centers  lifelines for tens of millions of people  open  well staffed  and well equipped 
 and the administration is cracking down on federally funded health care providers that turn away or otherwise discriminate against people on the basis of race  sex  age  national origin  or disability 
 democrats will keep working to grow the health care workforce  so workplace and other provider shortages no longer create barriers to quality care and inflate health care costs 
 we are investing in programs that train primary care practitioners  registered nurses  mental health specialists  and others to work across our health care system  including in rural and low income areas 
 the administration is also cracking down on surprise medical billing and junk health insurance  so patients are no longer ambushed by unexpected bills or scammed into buying low quality health coverage 
 democrats will expand  no surprise billing  to include costly ground ambulances  and well keep using antitrust laws to stop hospital  insurance  and big pharma mergers that undermine competition and increase health care prices for consumers 
 at the same time  democrats will keep fighting to ease the burden of medical debt  which makes it harder for millions of americans to get a mortgage or other loan for the future 
 democrats provided funding to forgive    billion in medical debt for nearly   million americans  and the administration is urging states to use remaining funds to do more 
 it already persuaded credit reporting agencies to exclude many medical debts from credit reports  boosting peoples credit scores and prospects for the future 
 in all  these actions have reduced the total number of americans with listed medical debt from    million in      to    million 
 democrats will keep pushing to exclude medical debts from credit scoring entirely 
 democrats also support the administrations historic work to close fundamental gaps in womens health care  including by protecting access to reproductive health care 
 this includes its efforts to reduce maternal mortality  led by vice president harris 
 she called for states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage for medicaid beneficiaries  with    states  the district of columbia  and the u 
 the administration is also making transformative investments in womens health research to find better ways to prevent  diagnose  and treat health conditions in women  and to make care more accessible and affordable 
 and it is leading game changing work to end cancer as we know it  including through the creation of the advanced research projects agency for health  arpa h  
 prescription drugs president biden  vice president harris  and democrats took on big pharma and won 
 democrats capped the price of insulin at     a month  down from as much as       for nearly   million seniors on medicare 
 and president biden persuaded the nations top three insulin makers to lower their prices for everyone 
 now  well fight to expand that     cap to cover everyone  saving millions of americans with diabetes nearly        a year 
 starting next year  the inflation reduction act also caps total out of pocket drug costs at        a year for millions of seniors and others on medicare 
 democrats will fight until that cap covers every single american 
 for the first time  medicare now also has the ability to negotiate lower drug prices  as private insurers and the va have done for decades 
 it started doing so this year  beginning with    commonly used medications for conditions such as diabetes and heart failure 
 democrats will push to add at least    drugs a year to that list  lowering prices for     drugs this decade 
 medicare part d is also working to cap cost sharing for life saving generics at    a dose  democrats will make this mandatory for all medicare beneficiaries 
 the administration is also leading the charge against big pharma price gouging  by requiring drugmakers that raise prices faster than inflation to pay the difference back to medicare  which will then pass savings on to consumers 
 this will protect over         seniors  who could save as much as        per over priced dose 
 democrats will keep fighting to expand these rebates  applying them when drugmakers overcharge not just medicare  but private insurers as well 
 were also cracking down on improper drug patent listings  which some drugmakers use to shut out competition 
 once companies drop their improper patent listings  other companies will be free to make cheaper alternatives 
 the ftcs work in this area has already pushed three of the biggest makers of inhalers to lower prices to     a month  saving people with asthma hundreds of dollars a year 
 the administration also enacted rules to finally make hearing aids available over the counter  saving millions of americans up to        a pair 
 and democrats will continue the administrations work to require that any drugs developed with taxpayer dollars be available to taxpayers  including at reasonable prices 
 democrats will keep working to lower drug prices by requiring more transparency from the  pharmacy benefit manager  middlemen who generally decide which drugs are covered by insurance and bought by doctors  and how much they cost 
 and theyll boost the federal budget  too reducing the deficit by      billion over the next ten years  as medicare no longer has to pay big pharma exorbitant prices 
 child care  home care    paid leave child   home care the united states cant have the best economy in the world without strong support for caregiving 
 but today  the cost of care is too high  pay for care workers is too low  and families are caught in the middle of a broken system 
 democrats understand that fixing the caregiving crisis cannot wait 
 during the pandemic  democrats american rescue plan kept         child care centers open  getting parents back to work and saving families an average        a year per child 
 it preserved a million care workers jobs  and increased their pay by    percent 
 it expanded support for home  and community based services for seniors and people with disabilities 
 last year  president biden issued a historic executive order directing agencies to further expand access to affordable care 
 the administration also capped child care costs for         low income families at   percent of their income  saving each an average        a year 
 overall  the administration increased federal child care funding by    percent 
 democrats will make investments like these permanent  and guarantee affordable  quality child care to millions of working families for less than     a day per child 
 and well restore the expanded child tax credit and strengthen head start 
 for seniors and people with disabilities  democrats will improve and expand home  and community based services  working toward finally eliminating the         person medicaid waiting list  so more people can live and work with dignity in their own communities 
 well also keep pushing to improve pay and benefits for care workers  for example by fighting to get many of them a bigger share of medicaid home care payments 
 democrats will overhaul the quality of care and quality of life for our nations   
  million nursing home residents by defending administration regulations that require minimum staffing standards at nursing homes 
 paid leave america is the worlds only advanced economy not to guarantee paid leave 
 the vast majority of employers dont offer it nearly three quarters of private sector employees dont have paid family leave through their jobs  including    percent of americas lowest paid workers 
 the pandemic only made the economic consequences of this failure more devastating 
 in the united states of america  no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them  a child who depends on them  and the paycheck that they need to survive 
 from day one  president biden has pushed to do more 
 he fought to include a comprehensive paid leave program in legislation that ultimately became the inflation reduction act 
 he instructed federal agencies to expand access to paid and unpaid leave for federal employees 
 he expanded the military parental leave program  so all active duty  new parent servicemembers can take    weeks 
 and his budget includes the strongest paid leave proposals in history  permanently funding the national paid leave plan that america needs 
 that plan will create americas first  full  national paid family and medical leave program  guaranteeing every american worker up to    weeks of paid time off to care for a new child or loved one to recover from an illness  in cases of domestic violence  or military deployment 
 it will help families care for one another  and it will help businesses retain valuable talent and small businesses to compete 
 millions more parents will be able to work  and it will add hundreds of billions to our economy 
 its past time that america caught up with the rest of the world 
 gas   groceries when the pandemic crushed supply chains  prices for everyday items  from food to gas to airfare  went up 
 but after supply bottlenecks eased  many companies didnt lower prices in line with their falling costs 
 president biden will keep calling those companies out for price gouging  and hold them accountable when they dont pass savings on to consumers 
 to lower prices  democrats will also keep working to boost supply  fix supply chains and promote competition  especially for essential items like gas and groceries that families depend on 
 through record energy production of clean energy  oil  and gas  weve lowered prices at the pump for american families 
 the administration also released nearly     million barrels of gasoline from the strategic petroleum and northeast gasoline supply reserves  and it is lowering gas prices by up to    cents per gallon more in certain markets  particularly in the midwest  by making cheaper  e   ethanol blended gasoline available each summer 
 and  the administration is cracking down to prevent collusion by oil companies that could raise prices more 
 the president also knows the frustration and fear that high grocery prices can cause  and he has taken action to lower costs for hard working families 
 he and his team have met repeatedly with grocery ceos and business leaders  who agreed this spring to lower prices 
 the administration is also cracking down on price gouging and promoting competition in agriculture  making everything from fertilizer to poultry processing more affordable for farmers 
 the president also signed into law the bipartisan ocean shipping reform act  which lowers shipping prices and helps american farmers export their goods 
 corporate greed today  corporate consolidation is allowing companies to keep raking in historic profits  while continuing to raise prices for working families 
 in the two decades before president biden came to office  three quarters of american industries grew more concentrated 
 as the president often says  capitalism without competition isnt capitalism  its exploitation 
 and the american people are tired of being played for suckers 
 the administration has taken historic steps to boost competition across our economy  in fields from finance and farming to technology and transportation 
 were banning non compete agreements so that workers have the freedom to pursue a new job or start a new business 
 were protecting consumers from unfair hidden  junk fees  and price gouging  and shoring up our banking system to keep peoples hard earned savings safe 
 during his first months in office  the president launched a competition council tasked with coordinating and advancing this work 
 agencies have taken dozens of actions to increase competition across markets and industries from making hearing aids available over the counter  to reducing cargo and rail shipping costs for goods  to support efforts to allow farmers and other americans to repair their own equipment 
 the justice department and the ftc have increased antitrust enforcement  releasing updated merger guidelines  and halting a slate of big mergers in the airline  food  and defense sectors that wouldve increased consumer prices 
 democrats will keep working to make the american economy more competitive for businesses and workers across sectors  from transportation to housing to food 
 and we will reform hiring and procurement processes across the government  to boost competition among our contractors and suppliers  too 
 the administration is also taking broad action to crack down on  junk fees   the hidden charges that companies add on to peoples bills without their knowledge  reducing consumer choice 
 weve already taken action to crack down on a range of these junk fees charged by airlines  internet providers  hotels  and apartment buildings 
 weve pushed banks to slash unfair overdraft and bounced check charges and took action to cap credit card late fees 
 were cracking down on junk health insurance plans that advertise one rate  but then stick patients with a much bigger medical bill 
 over time  these combined actions will save american families hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year adding up to more than     billion a year across the economy giving people a little more breathing room 
 and well keep pushing until we ban all junk fees across our economy 
 democrats are also working to shore up a safe  secure banking system that protects consumer deposits and holds investors accountable 
 democrats have pushed for legislation to hold executives at all failed banks accountable  clawing back compensation and banning them from the industry 
 were working to limit out of control wall street bonuses that encourage risky bank practices that jeopardize our whole economy 
 and well keep pushing to pass an updated glass steagall act  more clearly separating commercial and investment banking and expanding volcker rule safeguards 
 we defeated republican efforts to gut the consumer financial protection bureau at the supreme court this year  well continue to protect and strengthen that agency and support its critical work 
 housing a home is more than a roof over your head  its a place to raise your family  to build community  and to grow the american dream 
 its also the biggest investment  and the biggest monthly expense  that most people ever face 
 some    years after the subprime mortgage crisis devastated homeowners and froze construction nationwide  were still seeing the effect of a severe housing shortage thats pushing up prices and keeping homes out of reach 
 president biden has taken historic steps to help americans rent  buy  and build 
 in the depth of the pandemic  the american rescue plan kept   million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions 
 since then  the administration has eased rising rents by capping rent hikes in   million federally funded apartments 
 it led the biggest expansion of rental assistance for low income families in    years 
 its cracking down on slumlords who dont play by the rules 
 the administration has reduced mortgage insurance premiums on federally backed loans for         homeowners  and waived the requirement for title insurance  saving families up to        to refinance 
 more people own homes today than did before the pandemic  and were seeing fewer foreclosures than at any time in decades 
 but democrats know the surest way to bring housing costs down long term is to build to boost supply 
 so the administration is cutting red tape to help more builders get federal financing 
  million new housing units are under construction today nationwide 
 going forward  the president has laid out one of americas most ambitious housing plans in over    years 
 it expands rental assistance to a half million new households  including to low income veterans and young people aging out of foster care 
 it offers corporate landlords a basic choice for the next two years  either cap rent increases at   percent  or lose a valuable federal tax break 
 it offers a         mortgage relief tax credit to first time homebuyers  and         in down payment assistance to buyers from families where no one has ever before owned a home 
 at the same time  the administration is going after unfair rental  junk fees   like fees people are charged just to pay rent online or to receive sorted mail 
 and  we will crack down on corporate landlords who are gouging tenants  for example by capping the amount they can raise the rent each year  and we will go after negligent landlords who dont maintain basic habitability standards 
 we will also crack down on those who violate the fair housing act  and on landlords who discriminate against low income and minority renters and people with housing vouchers 
 we are rooting bias out of the home appraisal process  which perpetuates the racial wealth gap by unjustly undervaluing millions of black  and latino owned homes 
 the presidents plan also calls for funding to help build or renovate   million homes nationwide by expanding the low income housing tax credit for developers to build affordable rental housing  and by introducing a new neighborhood homes tax credit  the first ever to focus on creating affordable housing not for renters  but for homeowners 
 it also creates a housing innovation fund  to help state and local governments find new ways to increase supply  like by converting empty office or hotel space into apartments 
the plan also encourages state and local efforts to take on barriers to building new housing 
 democrats are dedicated to increasing the supply of an array of housing options like duplexes  triplexes  and townhomes that bridge the gap between single family homes and large apartment buildings 
 by reducing barriers to building housing and providing federal tax incentives for the development of housing for people of all incomes  we can foster vibrant  inclusive communities where people from all walks of life can find affordable  diverse living options 
 workforce housing must also be prioritized to ensure that our nations teachers  nurses  firefighters  and other essential workers can afford to live in the communities they serve 
 we recognize that these workers are the backbone of our society  but they are left to struggle with housing costs that outpace their incomes  leaving them unable to live near their workplaces 
 democrats will meet this challenge head on by increasing funding for programs that support the creation and preservation of affordable housing options for essential workers  as well as collaborating with state and local governments to accelerate the development of workforce housing  ensuring that our communities remain accessible and affordable for all 
 democrats are working to help americans cover other housing related costs  like utilities 
 families are already saving thousands of dollars with clean energy tax credits  and    million households received free or monthly discounts  saving     to     per month on high speed broadband through the largest internet affordability program in history 
 it expired in may  because republicans refused to act  but democrats will keep fighting to reinstate it 
 well keep working to expand other programs that reduce home heating  cooling  and water bills as well  especially in rural areas  and to speed the transition to cheaper renewable energy  like solar  that will lower peoples bills long term 
 the administration is also leading one of americas most ambitious efforts to prevent homelessness 
 based on a  housing first  principle  its helping states and cities prioritize housing as the foundational step in delivering support  services  and jobs to rebuild lives 
 the administration will work with congress and local jurisdictions to increase supportive and interim housing options  and the services necessary to help unhoused individuals stay permanently housed 
 education democrats fundamentally believe that every student deserves a quality education  regardless of their parents zip code or income 
 we know that education starts well before kids go to kindergarten 
 studies show that children who attend preschool are nearly    percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two  or four year degree  no matter their background 
 thats why democrats will provide free  universal preschool for four year olds  saving the families of   million children         a year 
 in the wake of the pandemic  thats especially urgent 
 the american rescue plan made the biggest investment in public education in history  providing      billion to help        districts reopen  rebuild  and catch kids up  funding that has worked to help our children learn 
 the historic investment spurred long overdue improvements in school facilities and indoor air quality  creating safe and healthy learning environments for students and school staff 
 since then  weve also provided an additional    billion to high need  title i schools 
 weve helped districts nationwide train and hire        more counselors and social workers  so kids can heal from the disruptions of covid  and cope with the fear of gun violence in order to focus on learning 
 we increased investments in full service community schools five fold  providing health care  nutrition  job training  and other wraparound services for kids at school  investing in their futures and making families lives easier 
 the administration supports a multitude of approaches that have been proven to help students learn  reducing chronic absenteeism by building social and emotional supports at schools  offering literacy programs  and setting high expectations for student attendance  providing intensive tutoring  extending the school day and school year  expanding community schools  and helping schools to lift student achievement  rather than punishing them based on state standardized tests 
 we support fully funding idea to prioritize students with disabilities and the special educator workforce 
 we support efforts to provide more timely  well rounded  actionable feedback on student learning and progress to educators and to families that will support instruction and student success  while upholding rigorous academic standards 
 we oppose the use of private school vouchers  tuition tax credits  opportunity scholarships  and other schemes that divert taxpayer funded resources away from public education 
 public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate 
 and well continue working to increase accountability at charters  holding them to the same transparency standards as public schools 
 well prioritize education in cutting edge steam fields as well  especially for students from underrepresented communities  preparing every child to compete and thrive 
 and were working to provide every student with a pathway to multilingual education  while ensuring equitable access to a high quality education for english learners  whove historically been underserved 
 a quality  postsecondary education used to be a ticket to the middle class  but the cost that many folks face for higher education today is crippling families  futures  and our entire economy 
 democrats will make quality  affordable  postsecondary education a path forward again 
 four year college is not the only pathway to a good career  so democrats are investing in other forms of education as well  including career and technical education 
 the administration is expanding job training partnerships that connect high schools  local businesses  and labor unions to prepare students for good jobs in high skill  high wage  and in demand industries 
 itll make trade school and community college free for every american 
 and its making record investments in registered apprenticeships which already train more than one million americans a year across industries  including cutting edge industries 
 some    percent of them stay on as full hires  earning an average starting salary of         a year 
 thats a path to the middle class that families can count on 
 a majority of college students graduate with student debt 
 it can be an overwhelming stress  as snowballing interest follows folks for decades  defining the choices they make and the jobs they take  and holding back our entire economy 
 although republican appointees on the supreme court blocked the presidents initial student debt relief plan for    million borrowers  he has not stopped using every available tool to provide relief 
 his administration already approved the cancellation of      billion in loans for nearly   million borrowers  including nearly a million public servants like teachers  nurses  and police  and it has outlined plans to deliver relief to    million borrowers in all 
 meanwhile  its new save plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history  helping   million americans including more than   
 these savings will transform lives  freeing people to buy a house  to start a family  or to launch a business with new hope 
 for young people just heading to college now  weve already secured the largest increase in pell grants in a decade  and well further expand these grants to   million more students  and double the maximum award by      
 weve invested a record     billion in historically black colleges and universities  hbcus   and were working to subsidize tuition at all minority serving institutions for anyone whose family earns less than          a year 
 at the same time  democrats have educators backs 
 teachers  education support professionals  paraprofessional and school related personnel  and specialized instructional support personnel are the heart and soul of our communities  they give so much of themselves  and inspire our children to dream 
 the administration has canceled student loan debts for more than         public servants  including educators 
 well recruit more new teachers  paraprofessionals and school related personnel  and education support professionals  with the option for some to even start training in high school  and well help school support staff to advance in their own careers with a living wage 
 we will improve working conditions and support to help make teaching a sustainable and affordable profession 
 well keep investing in partnerships with hbcus  msis  and tribal colleges and universities to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline  so students of every background can see themselves at the head of the classroom and in charge of their schools 
 social security  pensions    medicare the right to a secure and dignified retirement is one of the bedrock principles of american life 
 before social security  almost half of american seniors lived in poverty 
 even those whod spent a lifetime working didnt always have enough to put food on the table or health care they could count on 
 democrats changed that  in       we passed social security  in       we signed medicare and medicaid into law 
 these are more than government programs theyre a promise that weve made as a country  that after a lifetime of hard work  people deserve to retire with dignity and security 
 generations of americans have paid into these programs  with every paycheck of their lives 
 well never back down from our ironclad commitment to protecting social security  medicare  and medicaid 
 we reject any effort to privatize social security or to cut any of the benefits that the american people have earned 
  percent of their income to support social security  and the self employed pay twice that 
 but people with multi million dollar incomes pay a fraction of   percent 
 well strengthen the program and expand benefits by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share 
 we also oppose any actions to cut medicare benefits 
 well look to expand traditional medicare coverage to include dental  vision  and hearing services  which are so key to health and quality of life  by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share 
 the fact is that both social security and medicare are in a stronger fiscal position today than when president biden took office 
 our strong economic recovery has helped to extend medicare solvency by a decade 
 and the presidents prescription drug reforms will save it hundreds of billions of dollars  by finally empowering medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with drug companies  and to collect rebates if big pharma hikes prices faster than inflation 
 if republicans repeal our reforms  theyll erase those savings and put medicare itself at risk 
 democrats will make medicare permanently solvent  by making the wealthy pay their fair share in medicare taxes 
 chapter four  tackling the climate crisis  lowering energy costs    securing energy independence every year  the devastation caused by climate change grows more urgent 
 across the country  americans experience the dire impacts of climate change  floods and storms wipe more homes off the map 
 wildfire smoke spreads thousands of miles  forcing millions to shelter indoors 
 weve had the worst droughts in a thousand years  and the fastest sea level rise in over a century 
 natural disasters and extreme weather have cost america over one trillion dollars in damages in just the last seven years 
 and they hit the most vulnerable among us hardest seniors  people with disabilities  people in neighborhoods without resources to blunt the impact 
 president biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in history 
 his landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom thats slashing pollution  lowering energy costs  and has already created over         good paying american clean energy jobs 
 america is now producing more energy than ever in its history 
 he has taken more environmental actions than any president before him providing cleaner air and water  making communities more resilient  and forcing polluters to pay for the damage theyve done 
 he is on track to protect more of americas lands and waters than any president before him  and he has restored our global climate leadership 
 he is positioning america to lead the future energy independent  resilient  innovative  and strong 
 producing cleaner  more affordable energy across the world  were seeing massive new clean energy production and uptake 
 were at the dawn of a new era that will redefine the global economy  and that america must lead 
 president bidens investing in america agenda makes the largest clean energy investment in history  and it has already attracted over      billion in private sector commitments  to develop and manufacture solar  wind  battery  and other clean technologies here at home 
 today      new clean energy manufacturing projects are underway not just on the coasts  but in    states  including in places too often left behind 
 some    percent of the investments made since our landmark climate law passed are going to counties with below average weekly wages 
 america is making leaps forward in energy generation and storage  while modernizing our electricity grid and upgrading transmission lines to deliver reliable  clean power 
 private sector companies have announced investment in solar modules that will power    million homes  and the biden harris administration has approved the first nine commercial offshore wind projects in federal waters  set to power nearly   million homes 
 large scale energy storage capacity has increased twelve fold since the president took office  and is expected to double again by years end 
 this clean energy boom has already created over         jobs and lowered energy costs for millions of families 
 it puts us on track to triple clean energy generation by       reducing big oils hold on our economy  protecting families from wild price swings  and bringing america closer to energy independence than weve been in over    years 
 going forward  democrats will keep working to incentivize investment in transmission upgrades and new lines  and in the grid component manufacturing thats needed to support that growth 
 we will improve and speed up the processes of environmental review and clean energy permitting  and further scale up development of clean energy on public lands 
 well also continue to invest in clean energy research and development  building on americas legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities 
 to help find new ways of generating and storing energy  reducing emissions  and boosting climate resilience  well launch an advanced research projects agency for climate  arpa c   modeled on the defense research agency thats behind breakthrough technologies like the internet and gps  and the new arpa h that the administration created to transform medicine 
 well also establish a new national lab for climate research and innovation  affiliated with an hbcu  hispanic   or other minority serving institution  to ensure the opportunities of the future are available to everyone  and built by everyone 
 and we will continue to invest in climate research across nasa  noaa  the national science foundation  and other agencies  to make sure that america leads the world in clean energy innovation 
 lowering energy costs democrats historic climate and clean energy agenda is lowering energy costs for families and small businesses long term and today with cheaper  cleaner energy and with tax credits to make home energy use more efficient and affordable 
 americas clean energy boom is giving everyone more energy choices than ever  and more choices mean lower prices 
 according to the department of energy  our policies are expected to slash overall electricity rates by   percent and gas prices by as much as    percent by       saving americans tens of billions of dollars 
 at the same time  the inflation reduction act is providing tax credits and rebates to make americans homes more efficient  so families can immediately start saving on their energy costs  now and for years to come 
 families can reduce their bills up to        a year by making their homes more energy efficient with new insulation  windows  and doors  and by installing rooftop solar panels  home battery storage  and electric pumps for heating and cooling 
 democrats are also offering rebates on new  energy efficient appliances  and people can save up to        when they buy a new plug in hybrid or fully electric car  or        if they buy a used one 
 the administration has toughened efficiency standards on new appliances and cars as well  which will further reduce emissions and energy bills 
 new fuel economy and tailpipe standards alone are expected to save drivers some        per car by reducing fuel and maintenance costs 
 the administration has also taken historic action to lower gas prices at the pump  by standing up to big oils price gouging  releasing strategic reserves to blunt profiteering  and promoting competition with cleaner  cheaper  renewable fuel 
 creating clean energy jobs president biden has long said that when he thinks about climate change  he thinks about jobs 
 good paying union jobs that people can raise a family on 
 the clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom ignited by his landmark climate law has so far directly created over         jobs in communities nationwide  and were making sure those jobs meet rigorous worker and environmental safety standards 
 the legislation is helping to push american factory construction to an all time high as well  as we build new plants to make things like batteries and electric vehicles  solar panels and wind turbines  and bring the supply chains needed to power a clean energy future home 
 the presidents agenda also includes extended buy clean and buy america standards  requiring federal projects to use low carbon  american made cement  steel  and other materials  and providing credits for private companies to do the same  creating more american jobs 
 it also provides extra incentives for private companies to hire registered apprentices and pay prevailing wages 
 through executive action and with congress  democrats will continue to work to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars 
 to help prepare people for these jobs  democrats launched the american climate corps  a new workforce training and service initiative that will put more than        young americans to work on clean energy  conservation  and climate resilience projects nationwide 
 president biden has set a goal to triple the size of the american climate corps by the end of this decade  ensuring that young people are given the skills and tools they need to succeed in careers in our new clean energy and climate resilience economies 
 the administration is also making record investments in registered apprenticeships  including in clean energy industries 
 registered apprenticeships train more than a million americans a year across industries     percent of whom stay on in those jobs as full hires 
 were also boosting investment in stem education and workforce training programs for women and at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions  to make sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past 
 the administration is also investing in new sources of income for americas farmers  and working to make our farm sector the worlds first to reach net zero emissions by      
 under president bidens landmark climate law  the agriculture department is paying farmers to adopt climate smart practices  which sequester carbon from the atmosphere  improve soil health and biodiversity  and restore water cycles  all while opening new revenue streams from ecosystem services markets 
 already  over        farms covering    million acres have adopted these practices 
 above all  democrats will unite against the republican war on clean energy  blocking their obsessive attempts to repeal president bidens clean energy investments 
 republicans will not be allowed to pull the rug out from american clean energy businesses  send hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas  and strip all americans of cheaper  cleaner energy choices  all to please their special interest backers 
 reducing pollution   making polluters pay these transformative investments in american energy are lowering energy costs  creating good paying jobs  revitalizing local economies  and reducing pollution 
 transportation is americas biggest emitter  responsible for a third of emissions 
 the administration has put us on track to eliminate all carbon from the sector by      
 its making generational investments in transportation infrastructure  including in cleaner shipping  trucking  transit  rail  and aviation 
 it issued the toughest ever fuel economy and tailpipe standards  so new cars both get better mileage  and reduce emissions per mile by as much as    percent 
 with tax credits  democrats helped quadruple sales of electric vehicles  with the goal that    percent of all new passenger cars sold in the u 
 were protecting american children from asthma related diesel pollution by giving school districts rebates to buy thousands of electric school buses so kids dont have to breathe polluted air 
 well keep working to electrify the nations fleet of school buses  transit buses  and federal vehicles  including the u 
 well double funding to repair and expand active transportation and public transit  reducing pollution and traffic  and connecting people to jobs and opportunity 
 and well work to electrify our ports and waterways  prioritizing progress towards a goal of zero emissions freight 
 well keep pushing to reduce emissions from americas buildings and heavy industry 
 we support local and state efforts to adopt energy efficient building codes 
 well require that low carbon materials and clean power be used in all new federal buildings by       and invest in upgrading va hospitals  federal offices  and k    public school and community college buildings  making them innovative  energy efficient  and safe places to learn 
 and well support investments in heavy industry  to make america the leader in clean steel  cement  aluminum  and other products 
 we also set americas first national drinking water standard to finally protect local water supplies from pollution with pfas  toxic  forever chemicals  linked to cancer 
 through the bipartisan infrastructure law  were upgrading wastewater systems 
 and were replacing every toxic lead pipe in america long overdue work that will finally guarantee that every person in the country can turn on the faucet and drink clean water 
 the bipartisan infrastructure law also includes important work to speed the cleanup of toxic superfund and brownfield sites that have leached poisonous waste into nearby neighborhoods for decades 
 to cover those costs  the law finally restored a vital  polluter pays  tax that had lapsed    years before  once again collecting revenue on any chemical sold in the united states  and directing it to the superfund trust fund to pay for cleanup 
 at the same time  the administration has greatly increased civil and criminal enforcement of our nations environmental laws  boosting funding for the justice department and environmental protection agency  resulting in faster cleanups and tougher compliance 
 we support increased monitoring  transparency  and community engagement in this work 
 throughout  well keep standing up to big oil  as our clean energy boom breaks the industrys monopoly hold on energy markets 
 for the first time in     years  weve increased the royalties that oil and gas companies have to pay to drill or mine on public lands  and were charging at least    times more for the bonds that are required to hold companies accountable for cleaning up drilling sites or capping their abandoned wells  which have been left to spew methane 
 states and private landowners have for years charged more than the federal government does to lease their lands  its time the taxpayers got a similar return 
 going forward  well also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in other unfair oil and gas subsidies 
 when windfall profiteering causes prices to spike at the pump  well release our own supplies to keep costs down for american families 
 and  when we hear of potential collusion or price gouging  well hold oil and gas executives accountable 
 environmental justice for too long in this country  too many communities have been denied the basic security and dignity that comes from having clean air  clean water  and functioning infrastructure 
 too many parents still lay awake at night worrying what the rain or soil or water or air is doing to their kids 
 that kind of inequity goes against everything that we stand for as a nation 
 to finally change that  president bidens climate agenda includes the most ambitious environmental justice actions in history  making sure that the people whove suffered most from legacy pollution can now share in the benefits 
 during his first week in office  the president established the justice   initiative  with the goal of directing    percent of the benefits of our historic climate and clean energy investments to fenceline communities hit hardest by past pollution 
 last year  he gave the program new teeth  with an executive order requiring every federal agency to designate its own environmental justice officer to consider and improve the health impacts of its work on all communities 
 every major plank of our investing in america agenda shares that commitment to environmental justice 
 the bipartisan infrastructure law invests a record     billion in tackling legacy pollution  the biggest effort to right such wrongs in american history 
 were also investing in capping orphaned oil and gas wells  which leak deadly methane into surrounding communities well after big oil is gone 
 and to help ensure new climate and clean energy projects can get financed across america  particularly in communities historically left behind and overburdened by pollution  president biden and vice president harris launched a first of its kind     billion national financing network as part of the greenhouse gas reduction fund 
 this program will ensure communities across the country have access to the capital they need to participate in and benefit from a cleaner  more sustainable economy as we slash harmful climate pollution  improve air quality  lower energy costs  and create good paying jobs 
 our climate law makes major investments in long overdue clean water and sanitation as well 
 it launched a clean ports program to help ease the impact of air pollution around ports and airports  where thousands of trucks move goods in and out  often through neighborhoods experiencing distress as a result of historic disinvestment 
 it invests in clean public transit  connecting communities that have been isolated or disconnected by infrastructure and development to jobs  healthcare  education and opportunities 
 and under this climate law  millions of trees will be planted  deploying a nature based solution to combat the urban heat island effect by cooling our streets and easing the deadly impact of extreme heat on people living and working in these areas 
 we will continue to implement the presidents executive order on environmental justice for all  and will seek legislative options to further advance environmental justice 
 democrats also know we have a moral obligation to make sure that fenceline communities benefit from the clean energy revolution 
 programs like solar for all are helping to lower energy costs  by installing nearly a million solar rooftops in low income areas by      
 at the same time  were providing bonus tax credits to draw clean energy and clean manufacturing to former fossil fuel and legacy power plant communities 
 they powered our nation for generations and deserve a just transition away from fossil fuels 
 building climate resilient communities we have an urgent obligation to make every community in america more resilient to climate change and extreme weather 
 a record more than       americans died after extreme heat exposure last year  making it the top weather related killer  while as a country  we had to build back from    separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters 
 the presidents infrastructure and climate laws are improving our climate resilience by boosting readiness and response  including by recruiting and retaining more wildland firefighters  and increasing budgets at fema 
 and  theyre preparing us to better mitigate the impact of each extreme weather event as well 
 weve taken unprecedented steps to reinforce our nations infrastructure  building new roads  bridges  and ports that are less vulnerable to flooding 
 were putting power lines underground  so winds cant bring them down where they catch fire 
 were making our electric grids more reliable and more energy efficient  so families and businesses dont lose power in critical moments 
 were restoring wetlands to help protect communities from sea level rise and storm surge 
 weve stabilized the colorado river system  which provides water for more than    million americans  after the worst drought in over a thousand years 
 well continue investing in public safety measures  like resiliency and cooling centers  so everyone  including our most vulnerable residents  can find refuge during extreme weather events 
 and were looking out for workers  who often risk their lives on the job in extreme weather  with president biden for example introducing the first national heat standards to protect workers from dangerous heat last year 
 going forward  democrats will work to pass the bipartisan disaster resilience tax credit  to help low  and middle income families and small businesses invest in preparing for and easing the impact of storms  heat  floods  and other natural disasters 
 conservation americas natural wonders are our nations heart and soul 
 they unite and inspire us  and connect us to something bigger than ourselves 
 from his first day in office  president biden has taken historic steps to protect  conserve  and restore them 
 he set our nations first ever national conservation goal to protect at least    percent of our lands and waters by       including by supporting locally led  voluntary efforts 
 today  he is on track to conserve more american lands and waters than any president in history over    million acres so far  including dozens of new national monuments  wildlife refuges  and other protected areas  from the grand canyon to the great lakes 
 going forward  democrats will increase protections for americas arctic  and ensure clean water for all americans by protecting rivers and wetlands 
 well protect our oceans by working to designate new marine sanctuaries  and protect coastal communities from climate impacts 
 well keep pushing to fully fund the land and water conservation fund  partnering with state and local governments  and work to reduce threats to iconic old growth forests 
 well reward americans across the country who engage in voluntary conservation on private lands  and well work with landowners to protect endangered species and our economy by restoring habitats and enhancing biodiversity  and continuing to protect lands and waters as national monuments 
 global climate leadership with these historic actions and sustained engagement  president biden has restored americas global climate leadership  once again making our nation the worlds pivotal force against climate change 
 the united states rejoined the paris climate agreement on day one of his presidency  and president biden set an ambitious goal to reach net zero emissions by       in line with climate science 
 he used the restored power of americas example to press other nations to do more  persuading     countries to agree to slash methane emissions  a potent greenhouse gas  by at least    percent by the end of this decade 
 the united states is increasing the resilience  diversity  and security of our clean energy supply chains  while making sure they reflect our values  including by creating good paying  safe jobs for workers 
 the administration has rallied the world to commit for the first time to transitioning away from fossil fuels 
 it set a bold new goal for nations to triple renewable energy worldwide and to double energy efficiency by       and it helped to launch a new global clean energy supply chain partnership to make that happen 
 as democrats  we believe the united states has an indispensable role to play in solving the climate crisis  and we have an obligation to help other nations carry out this work 
 americas leadership in domestic clean energy development is driving a global cycle of innovation and investment that will help lower the cost of clean energy technologies in a fair and transparent way for all nations 
 we believe that international climate finance is an important tool in this fight 
 thats why the administration committed to achieve     billion dollars of climate financing a year by       to help develop the international clean energy market 
 and it worked with other nations to achieve a landmark global goal of mobilizing      billion in collective climate financing by       fulfilling a promise of the      paris agreement 
 going forward  well continue to support efforts to boost funding for initiatives like prepare  our program to build out better early warning systems for climate impacts in critical regions of the globe 
 we will use americas leadership to drive global innovation and build out clean energy supply chains 
 well work through the multilateral development bank to elevate climate and clean energy priorities within the global development finance system 
 and well build on our leadership in innovative debt for nature swaps  which have helped countries from barbados to gabon to restructure over    billion in debt so far  unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars for nature and climate investments 
 chapter five  protecting communities   tackling the scourge of gun violence all americans deserve freedom from fear  to be confident that their children will come home safely from the store or the playground  and to know that their loved one will come home safely from their shift policing the streets 
 young americans deserve a president whos fighting to keep guns out of school 
 women deserve a president who has worked his whole life to end violence against women 
 families deserve a president who has delivered safer neighborhoods 
 under president biden  in      the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than    years 
 he defeated the gun lobby and passed the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly    years 
 and  democrats provided funding for communities to hire more police 
 americans deserve the freedom to be safe  and america is safer today than when president biden first took office 
 gun safety the gun violence epidemic is a scourge ripping apart our communities  it is the leading cause of death for children and teens 
 mass shootings at schools  grocery stores  houses of worship  dancehalls  and nightclubs  as well as daily gun violence at home and on streets  devastate american families 
 president biden has been fighting and beating the gun lobby for decades  and hes continued to do so as president 
 with his leadership  congress passed the bipartisan safer communities act  bsca   the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly    years 
 it includes the first ever federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law  enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under the age of     funding to implement red flag laws  a narrowing of the  boyfriend loophole  to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers  and new requirements so all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise 
 and  the law helps schools hire and train an estimated        school based mental health professionals  including counselors  psychologists  and social workers 
 president biden also established the first ever white house office of gun safety prevention   led by vice president harris   and took nearly    gun safety executive actions  including going after dangerous  ghost guns 
  he launched new law enforcement strike forces within the department of justice to crack down on gun trafficking 
 democrats will establish universal background checks  a step supported by the vast majority of americans  including gun owners 
 we will once again ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines 
 democrats will end the gun industrys immunity from liability  so gunmakers can no longer escape accountability 
 we will pass a national red flag law to prevent tragedies by keeping weapons out of dangerous hands 
 we will increase funding to the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms  atf  for enforcement and prosecution  and to the federal bureau of investigation  fbi  for firearm background checks 
 and  because the gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis  we will fund gun violence research across the centers for disease control  cdc  and national institutes of health  nih  as well as community violence interventions 
 policing   public safety president biden recognizes the sacrifices police officers and their families make to keep our communities safe 
 every day  officers risk their lives for the safety of people they do not know 
 and since day one  president biden has been working to make sure police officers have the tools they need to protect their communities  including more police officers on the street 
 we need to fund the police  not defund the police 
 democrats passed and president biden signed the american rescue plan  with the largest ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime  reducing violence  and investing in public safety 
 that funding enabled cities and states to invest more than     billion in public safety and violence prevention  putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing  as well as interrupting and preventing crime 
  billion to state   see app note  local  tribal  and territorial law enforcement agencies  research institutions  and nonprofits to advance public safety including funding for       new police officers in nearly     communities 
 because police officers should be able to focus on fighting crime  president biden secured the first ever federal funding solely dedicated to community violence intervention programs  and he increased funding for crisis interventions  mobile crisis teams  and training for first responders and law enforcement 
 president biden also signed legislation replenishing the crime victims fund  which supports programs that assist survivors 
 democrats also secured funding for extra security at places of worship and community institutions  and we are investing in tribal public safety 
 public trust  as any police officer will tell you  is the foundation of public safety 
 police cannot fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and confidence in law enforcement and in the criminal justice system 
 yet  there are places in america today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken 
 president biden took action to enhance public trust by signing a historic executive order on police reform alongside george floyds family 
 he launched the national law enforcement accountability database with information on misconduct by federal law enforcement officers  and sharply restricted chokeholds and no knock warrants for federal law enforcement 
 and  the administration is publishing data on the use of force and is also preventing certain militarized equipment from being sold or transferred to local police agencies 
 president biden is committed to making our country safer for every american  civilians and law enforcement alike 
 democrats will pass his safer america plan  which calls on congress to invest     billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention 
 that includes funding         additional police officers for accountable community policing and    billion in community violence intervention  which will help prevent crime  keep communities safe  and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve 
 we will create a new violent crime reduction and prevention fund to give federal  state  local  and tribal law enforcement the resources they need to fight crime  including to hire more agents  prosecutors  and forensic specialists 
 we will give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime  retail crime  and carjacking 
 democrats will build on the progress in president bidens executive order on effective  accountable policing by passing the george floyd justice in policing act 
 and  we will end racial profiling and religious discrimination in law enforcement 
 criminal justice president biden is committed to rehabilitation and reentry for people returning to their communities after incarceration  and to building a criminal justice system that lives up to those ideals and ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law 
 thats why hes taken historic steps to make this promise a reality 
 no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana 
 sending people to prison for possession has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit 
 those criminal records impose needless barriers to employment  housing  and educational opportunities  disproportionately affecting black and brown people 
 president biden took historic action to end this failed approach by pardoning people convicted federally for using or possessing marijuana 
 he has called on governors to use their pardon power to do the same for state level offenses 
 and his administration is taking a major step to reschedule cannabis so its no longer classified as more dangerous than fentanyl or methamphetamine 
 president biden has released a comprehensive strategic plan to improve the criminal justice system and strengthen public safety  including more than     concrete actions 
 the administration is improving rehabilitation in jails and prisons and helping people rebuild their lives  an important step in reducing recidivism 
 it has invested nearly    billion in job training  addiction recovery  and reentry services across the country  and expanded access to pell grants  so people can earn a college degree while they are incarcerated  starting over with new skills 
 the administration will keep investing in housing  mentorship  job training  and apprenticeship programs as well 
 it is working to end the school to prison pipeline by reissuing guidance from the departments of education and justice to prevent disparate discipline of children of color and with disabilities and incentivizing states to develop community based alternatives to prison for young people 
 and  president biden reestablished the justice departments standalone office for access to justice to ensure that everyone can get legal assistance 
 president biden has used his pardon power to right historical wrongs 
 in addition to pardoning simple possession and use of marijuana  hes pardoned or shortened the sentences of people convicted of other nonviolent drug offenses and pardoned approximately       gay  lesbian  and bisexual veterans who were convicted years ago just for being themselves 
 democrats will take action to expunge federal marijuana only convictions 
 we will combat drug trafficking and expand the use of drug courts  interventions  and diversion for people with substance use disorders 
 we will fund a new accelerating justice system reform grant program to provide jurisdictions with critical resources to foster community trust and safety  reduce inequity and justice system involvement  and alleviate burdens on police 
 we will expand access to public defenders and step up civil rights enforcement  including by boosting funding for the justice departments civil rights division and hiring    new assistant u 
 and  we will remove barriers to legal access  combat hate crimes  and counter cyber threats 
 to keep children and teens safe and out of the justice system  we will invest in after school programs  community centers  and summer jobs 
 and  to ensure young people get a second chance after leaving the justice system  we will automatically seal and expunge juvenile records 
 democrats will end state level use of private prisons and detention centers  and we will restrict state and local practices like solitary confinement  chokeholds  and restraints on pregnant inmates 
 we will guarantee access to medical care in prison and will eliminate profiteering from diversion  bail  electronic monitoring  commissaries  and reentry programs 
 we will support rehabilitation and education  including college programs  for inmates in prison and after their release 
 to help returning citizens succeed upon their release  we will boost access to transitional housing  affordable housing  mental health and substance use treatment 
 we will limit reincarcerating people federally to only serious violations of supervised release 
 and  we will work to expand  ban the box  so returning citizens can more easily find work  protect their right to vote  and protect their right to public services like pell grants and nutrition assistance 
 violence against women ending violence against women has been the cause of president bidens life 
 senate  with the help of courageous and committed advocates  he wrote the original violence against women act and spent the following decades working to expand and improve it with each reauthorization 
 as president  he was proud not only to reauthorize this landmark law but also to strengthen it 
 democrats secured the highest ever funding level for vawa implementation  and are distributing record funding for local prosecutors  law enforcement  and survivor advocates 
 crucially  the administration has also expanded support for native survivors and strengthened protections for tribal communities  improved prevention and services for survivors of sexual assault  including through the fairness for rape kit backlog survivors act  expanded housing protections for domestic violence survivors  and increased services and support for survivors  including survivors of technology facilitated abuse 
 president biden launched the first ever national plan to end gender based violence  and the american rescue plan provided immediate crisis intervention  health supports  and emergency services for survivors 
 he expanded funding for campus sexual assault prevention and is keeping students safe on campus by restoring and strengthening protections under title ix  including explicit protections for lgbtqi  students 
 he signed legislation that narrowed the  boyfriend loophole  to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers 
 he signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace 
 and  he signed a historic executive order on sexual assault and domestic violence in the military  transferring key decision making authority from commanders to independent military prosecutors the most significant transformation of the military justice system since the uniform code of military justice was established in      
 democrats will work to end sexual assault  domestic violence  online abuse  and all violence against women 
 we continue to strengthen vawa  keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers  and expand housing and legal services for survivors 
 to keep students safe on campus  we will work with schools to implement and enforce title ix and end sexual harassment and assault in our nations schools 
 and  we will strengthen legal protections for and support survivors of deepfake image based sexual abuse building on the federal civil cause of action established under the presidents reauthorization of vawa in      
 chapter six  strengthening democracy  protecting freedoms    advancing equity president biden  vice president harris  and democrats know that democracy has always been americas sacred cause 
 whether thats still true is the most urgent question of our time  and its what the      election is all about 
 the president  vice president  and all democrats will continue to work every day to ensure that our democracy endures 
 president biden spent his first term working to restore trust in our institutions  protect our freedoms  and preserve our democracy for the future 
 president biden  vice president harris  and democrats have consistently made it clear that political violence has no place in america 
 together  we will continue uniting and rallying americans across the political spectrum in defense of our democracy  and making it clear that political violence has no place in america 
 we will defend our freedoms  restore essential trust in our institutions  and preserve americas vital role as a beacon of democracy across the world 
 judges one of a presidents most important duties is appointing the judges who shape our countrys laws 
 they have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back 
 they hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions  whether americans have the freedom to cast their ballots  whether workers have the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families  whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water  and whether a president is above the law 
 judicial appointments are crucial at every level of the federal bench  but nowhere more so than on the supreme court 
 the next president could appoint one  two  or more new supreme court justices 
 those justices will determine what freedoms americans have or lose for the next         or even    years 
 president biden will continue to appoint justices and judges across the federal bench who are like justice jackson  brilliant jurists committed to defending american rights and freedoms 
 judges should reflect the diverse population whose laws they shape  and president biden has appointed more than     highly qualified federal judges who look like america 
 nearly two thirds of the judges hes appointed have been women  and nearly two thirds have been people of color 
 president biden has appointed more black women to federal circuit courts than every other president combined  more latino judges have been confirmed to circuit courts than under any other president  more aanhpi judges have been confirmed than in any other administration  and after only one term  he is already tied for the most openly lgbtqi  judges appointed 
 president biden has also chosen judges from diverse professional backgrounds  ensuring a range of perspectives and experiences are represented on the federal bench  at least    of his judicial appointees are former public defenders  at least    have served as civil rights lawyers  and at least nine have represented workers 
 in president bidens second term  he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the american experience 
 we will push for a supreme court that follows the rule of law  protects peoples freedoms  and abides by the highest ethical standards 
 voting rights the right to vote and to have your vote counted is the threshold of american democracy and liberty 
 without it  nothing is possible  with it  anything is 
 decades after a generation of civil rights leaders faced fire hoses and batons  were brutally beaten and even died to secure this fundamental right  it remains under assault 
 since their first days in office  president biden and vice president harris have taken action to protect the sacred right to vote in free  fair  and secure elections  especially for communities of color who have been historically disenfranchised 
 within the first     days of his presidency  president biden signed an executive order directing an all of government effort to promote access to voting 
 agencies have taken historic action to help veterans  college students  native americans  and other underserved communities register to vote 
 because laws are only as effective as their enforcement  the department of justice has more than doubled its staff dedicated to enforcing voting rights laws 
 and because the american people deserve to have faith in their elections  president biden signed the electoral count reform act to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the january   insurrection 
 congress must restore the protections of the voting rights act and take additional steps to ensure access to the ballot box 
 democrats will pass and president biden will sign the john r 
 lewis voting rights advancement act and the freedom to vote act to fully secure the right to vote in every state  ensure fair congressional maps for every american  modernize and secure our elections  and curtail the corrupting influence of money in politics 
 stopping the influence of special interests too much money flows in the shadows to influence our elections 
 advocacy groups can run ads on issues attacking or supporting a candidate right until election day without disclosing whos paying for that ad 
 too often  powerful special interests use front groups to run these ads to win at any cost 
 even foreign entities that arent allowed to contribute to political campaigns use dark money loopholes to try to influence our elections 
 to fight back  president biden has called for immediate passage of the disclose act  which will require advocacy groups that run ads to influence elections to disclose donors who contribute more than          and ban foreign entities from contributing to them 
 under president bidens leadership  the fec has also finalized a rule expanding political advertising disclaimer requirements for online public communications 
 democrats will also fight to strengthen public financing with small dollar matching for all federal candidates and crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections 
 we will keep super pacs wholly independent of campaigns and parties and pass a constitutional amendment that will ban all private financing from federal elections 
 democrats will end  dark money  by requiring full disclosure of contributors and ban     c     organizations from spending on elections 
 and  to curb the influence of special interests in our elections  democrats will prohibit corporate pacs and lobbyists from donating to anyone they lobby 
 trust in democracy is critical to protecting democracy 
 democrats will adopt ethics reforms to ensure every american can feel confident that their government is working for them  not for special interests 
 democrats will enact legislation to apply similar standards to members of congress 
 democrats will create a federal ethics commission to strengthen good governance laws  like those requiring financial and lobbying disclosure 
 democrats will require all federal candidates to disclose at least    years of tax returns 
 to ensure tax dollars go to work for the american people  not for special interests  democrats will reestablish merit based federal contracting and ban political appointees from interfering in grantmaking 
 and to ensure that policy decisions are guided by whats best for the american people  not by special interests  democrats will strengthen laws that regulate lobbying by foreign governments and lower the threshold for registering as a federal lobbyist 
 reproductive freedom over the past two years  more than    states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans many of which include no exception even for rape or incest that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy  force women to travel hundreds of miles for care  and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide 
 laws that limit access to contraception and to fertility treatments like ivf 
 more than one in three women of reproductive age  and more than half of black women and    percent of latinas  now live under an abortion ban 
 today  our daughters have fewer rights than their grandmothers 
 president biden  vice president harris  and democrats are fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state 
 president biden signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum to stand up for reproductive rights

 women in america are dying at a higher rate from pregnancy related causes than women in any other wealthy nation  especially black and native women 
 vice president harris came into office as a key leader on maternal health and continues to lead the fight for improved maternal health outcomes  elevating the issue nationally and convening experts and activists to find solutions

 racial equity since day one  the administration has championed an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda to ensure the full and fair participation of all communities in our economy and democracy  and to ensure the promise of america for everyone  including black  latino  and asian american  native hawaiian  and pacific islander  aanhpi  americans 
 democrats are building a strong economy from the bottom up and the middle out 
 black and latino unemployment has hit record lows under president biden  and the aanhpi employment rate is at its highest since      
 wages are rising faster than prices  and the greatest gains have gone to the low paid workers 
 the ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of american democracy  but our laws  public policies  and institutions too often exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and communities 
 president biden signed two executive orders to change that  including by increasing access to federal contracting dollars  capital  and lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses  reducing discrimination in the housing market  protecting overburdened communities from environmental harms  addressing historic disinvestment and infrastructure neglect  addressing health and health care disparities  rooting out educational inequities and preserving pathways to equal opportunity  tackling persistent poverty and building economic prosperity in rural communities  promoting equity and fairness in the justice system  combating bias  discrimination and hate based violence  and bolstering proactive enforcement that protects the civil rights of all americans 
 democrats expanded the child tax credit to millions more families  slashing the child poverty rate in half to record lows  including for black  latino  and aanhpi children 
 well keep fighting to make that expansion permanent 
 the administration has also expanded food assistance to those in need  providing the typical low income family of four about        more for groceries each year by improving snap  and it launched a summer food benefits program that serves nearly    million children 
 democrats will keep working to increase food security  including through wic and summer ebt  and by bringing back the enhanced child tax credit 
 starting a business is part of the american dream  and democrats are working to make that possible for everyone  boosting access to capital and loans  and to business through government contracting work 
 today  black americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in    years  and latinos at the fastest rate in over a decade 
 since the pandemic  the share of black households owning a business has more than doubled  latino business ownership is up    percent  and women own a record share of businesses 
 the administration set a goal that    percent of federal contracts go to small disadvantaged businesses  sdbs and will continue expanding these opportunities for sdbs in a second term 
 the small business administration  sba  has doubled the number and dollar value of loans awarded to black owned businesses  and doubled the rate of sba backed loans to latino owned small businesses 
 we eliminated the ban on sba lending to people on probation or parole  and banned  the box  on sba loan forms  so that people are no longer asked about their past records when applying for a loan 
 and  the minority business development agency  now a permanent part of the commerce department  is opening new offices and building partnerships with hbcus  in its work to help minority owned businesses across the country to overcome barriers and grow 
 the administration has also increased investment in community development financial institutions  cdfis  and minority depository institutions  mdis   and issued new licenses for nonbank lenders  helping more people in underserved communities to get capital and start businesses 
 as part of this work  vice president harris launched the economic opportunity coalition bringing together major corporations and foundations to align public and private sector investments with a particular focus on driving private investment in cdfis and mdis 
 by investing in community lenders  were driving an estimated      billion more in loans to black and latino communities over the next decade 
 going forward  well double that funding for cdfis  and expand and make permanent a new markets tax credit  to encourage development in places too long left behind 
 the robust economic recovery that president biden is leading is also working to close the persistent racial wealth gap that has plagued our country for generations 
 today  black wealth has climbed    percent since before the pandemic  latino homeownership is higher than before the pandemic  and median latino household wealth is up    percent in the last three years 
 homeownership is one of the most important ways that families can build wealth 
 the administration launched a first of its kind task force to end pernicious bias in the home appraisal process  which has for too long undervalued black  and latino owned homes 
 since then  the likelihood that a home in a black community is undervalued compared to a home in a white community has been cut by more than    percent 
 democrats are working to bring down housing costs across the board 
 the american rescue plan kept   million families in their homes throughout the pandemic  and the president has since introduced the most ambitious housing agenda in    years  with plans to boost supply  lower rent  and make homeownership more affordable 
 it includes down payment assistance for first generation homeowners and a mortgage relief tax credit for first time homebuyers  which will disproportionately benefit communities of color 
 we are also working to connect communities that have been isolated from opportunity for too long 
 highways and rail lines have disproportionately torn through black  latino and low income areas  displacing and segregating residents and businesses  stifling economic growth and investment  and cutting people off from groceries  jobs  and health care 
 through the bipartisan infrastructure law  we are righting those historic wrongs by investing in new roads  bridges  railways  and public transit and more  we know that no childs future should be determined by their parents income or zip code 
 weve made historic investments in education in the last four years  boosting funding for title i and community schools  investing in thousands of new school counselors and mental health providers  and supporting efforts to boost attendance and expand tutoring and summer programs

 and  where maga extremists are politicizing our classrooms  banning books  and trying to erase history  we are fighting back  including by appointing a federal coordinator to address the threat these bans pose to students civil rights 
 were also investing in recruiting and training teachers from all communities  including in partnership with hbcus  msis  and tcus  and helping them to get the pay that they deserve 
 it matters to children when they see someone who looks like them at the front of a classroom 
 democrats are also working to make college more affordable  and to relieve the crippling burden of student debt  which disproportionately falls on students of color 
 black students take on    percent more debt than white peers  and both black and latino borrowers are more likely to hold debt many years longer after graduation  deferring their dreams to buy a home  build a family  or start a business 
 thats why the presidents action to cancel      billion in student loans for nearly five million americans  and to ease repayment for millions of others is such an important step in leveling the playing field for everyone 
 to help more low income students afford college in the first place  the administration has also increased the maximum pell grant by       and will double it in the future 
 were expanding access to free community college  providing subsidized tuition for children from families earning less than          a year who attend hbcus  tcus  hispanic  and minority serving institutions 
 the administration has made historic investments in those schools  as well as in registered apprenticeships  to train americans everywhere for the careers of the future

 and were investing in climate resilient infrastructure that will protect every part of this country from extreme weather and other consequences of climate change 
 democrats will also keep fighting to address disparities in health care and make sure every american has access to quality  affordable health care 
 weve continued to protect and expand the affordable care act  expanding coverage to more americans ever in history  and were taking historic steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs like capping insulin at     a month and prescription drug costs at        a year for seniors and well keep fighting to expand those caps for every american 
 we will keep pushing to provide medicaid like coverage to people in states that have not expanded medicaid  and to make it easier for parents to keep children enrolled in medicaid and chip 
 well defend all womens right to reproductive health care

 and  we will address the disproportionate impact of infectious diseases  including hiv and hepatitis c  and expand access to prep to end the hiv epidemic 
 we have a long way to go to realize the full promise of america  but we are committed as a party to continuing the work to build a nation where all people are not only created equal  but treated equally throughout their lives 
 to determine how best to right historical wrongs  democrats support congress executing a study of reparations and the continuing impacts of slavery 
 lgbtqi  for generations  lgbtqi  americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly  even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk 
 lgbtqi  americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are  and to enrich every aspect of american life 
 but the fight for equality is far from over  as the lgbtqi  community continues to face attacks and bigotry in states across the country

 chapter seven  securing our border   fixing the broken immigration system since our founding  immigrants have traveled to america to pursue freedom and opportunity  to flee oppression  and to reunite with family members  and in turn have made our country stronger 
 president biden has led with the conviction that we must secure our border and fix a broken immigration system decades in the making 
 through it all  the united states must continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity 
 on his first day in office  president biden sent congress legislation to secure our border  fix our immigration system  and provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers and others 
 this past year  the president worked across the aisle and negotiated a bipartisan deal that included the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades 
 it would have made our country safer and made our border more secure  while treating people fairly and humanely and expanding legal immigration  consistent with our values as a nation 
 president biden has led a hemispheric response to the challenge of irregular migration  launching and leading the los angeles declaration for migration and protection with    countries to increase enforcement  expand legal pathways to citizenship  and stabilize and integrate migrants in neighboring countries 
 president biden has taken decisive action to secure our border through executive actions that have significantly restricted eligibility for asylum at the border and created innovative legal pathways to the u 
 that  when coupled with strong enforcement  have decreased illegal border crossings 
 since president biden announced new border restrictions in june       the number of unlawful crossings has fallen by    percent  demonstrating that the policy works 
 he has also implemented policies that have stopped record amounts of fentanyl from crossing our border 
 in president bidens second term  he will push congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation 
 legislation must secure the border  reform the asylum system  expand legal immigration  and keep families together by supporting a pathway for long term undocumented individuals  improving the work authorization process  and securing the future of the daca program 
 president biden has taken action to advance each of these goals  but lasting  comprehensive reforms require congressional action 
 securing the border the president has already taken steps to increase border resources  working within the limits imposed by congress 
 he has increased the number of agents and officers on the southwest border to over         added thousands of additional support personnel  surged thousands of law enforcement and other personnel from across the department of homeland security  and secured the first significant increase of border patrol agents in more than a decade 
 the bipartisan infrastructure law modernized border stations and land border ports of entry 
 the administration is providing support to cities and states  on the border and across the country  that are sheltering migrants 
 he has also taken executive actions  including launching expedited immigration court dockets  to more quickly resolve immigration cases for those crossing the southern border and remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain 
 president biden has repeatedly asked congress for additional resources to secure our border  including increases for personnel that are critically needed to quickly deliver consequences at the border to those who cross unlawfully 
 the department of homeland security requested funds to hire       border patrol agents and       asylum officers 
 meanwhile  the bipartisan senate bill would have provided an additional       customs and border protection personnel and       asylum officers 
 congressional republicans continue to play partisan politics with the security of our border instead of working with democrats to fund these critically needed resources for dhs and border communities 
 in president bidens second term  he will push congress to provide the resources and authorities that we need to secure the border 
 this includes additional border patrol agents  immigration judges  asylum officers  cutting edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl  and funding for cities and states that are sheltering migrants 
 reform the asylum system congress must pass legislation to reform our asylum system modeled after the bipartisan senate deal so that we can quickly identify and provide protection to those who are fleeing persecution and ensure it is not used as an alternative to legal immigration by others 
 democrats believe that asylum processing should be efficient and fair  and that those who are determined not to have a legal basis to remain should be quickly removed 
 in order to achieve this  we need congress to strengthen requirements for valid asylum claims 
 congress must also finally fund a sufficient number of asylum officers and immigration judges to facilitate timely decisions 
 in addition  asylum seekers  especially the most vulnerable  including unaccompanied children  should have access to legal counsel 
 individuals who pass this strengthened initial screening and are determined to be likely to qualify for asylum should be given quick access to work authorization while they go through a streamlined court process 
 after congress repeatedly failed to act  president biden announced executive action that significantly curtailed asylum eligibility at the border when crossings reach a certain threshold and strengthened our ability to impose timely consequences for crossing the border illegally 
 those who attempt to cross into the united states unlawfully are being quickly returned to their home countries  as well as mexico 
 since the president took this action  unlawful entries between ports of entry declined by more than half 
 and  president biden is changing the asylum process to more quickly screen and identify individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety so that they can be swiftly removed 
 temporary emergency authority to shut down the border when the system is overwhelmed  the president should have emergency authority to expel migrants who are crossing unlawfully and stop processing asylum claims except for those using a safe and orderly process at ports of entry 
 the authority should be accompanied by humanitarian exceptions for vulnerable populations including unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking 
 congress should also dedicate resources to detain and remove individuals quickly  and rapidly process those who cannot be detained in a non custodial setting under government supervision 
 those who pose a threat to public safety or national security must be identified and removed as quickly as possible 
 fighting human trafficking we need more resources and congressional authorization to increase penalties to prosecute and punish human smugglers and traffickers who prey upon families and migrants 
 president biden has already taken numerous steps to go after these bad actors including by revoking the visas of private sector ceos and sanctioning government officials who profit from migrants coming to the u 
 unlawfully  and by expanding efforts to dismantle human smuggling and prosecute offenders 
 president biden also established joint task force alpha  a law enforcement task force that marshals the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the department of justice  in partnership with the department of homeland security  dhs   to enhance u 
 enforcement efforts against the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in mexico and the northern triangle countries of guatemala  el salvador  and honduras 
 joint task force alpha has delivered significant results  including  over     u 
 convictions against leaders  organizers  and significant facilitators of human trafficking and substantial seizures and forfeitures of assets including cash  property  and firearms 
 cracking down on trafficking illicit fentanyl president biden has made fighting the trafficking of fentanyl a top priority 
 he has seized record amounts of fentanyl at our border and arrested more individuals for fentanyl related crimes in the last two years than in the previous five years combinedand secured funding for more cutting edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest border 
 he also issued an executive order to go after the global illicit fentanyl trade  which led to the imposition of sanctions on some     persons and entities 
 president biden has also continued working with mexico to extradite and prosecute key fentanyl traffickers  and negotiated the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics with china  which had been stalled since      
 as a result of these efforts  the number of fentanyl related deaths has started to decline for the first time in five years 
 in his second term  president biden will work with congress to deploy more cutting edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our ports of entry 
 he will also leverage all resources of the federal government to stop tech platforms from being used for criminal conduct  including sales of dangerous drugs like fentanyl 
 expanding legal immigration   deterring illegal immigration america is a nation of immigrants 
 the legal immigration framework was last updated in      and does not reflect the needs of our country in the   st century 
 many immigrants today are forced to wait years  and often decades  to immigrate lawfully to the united states 
 a robust immigration system with accessible lawful pathways and penalties for illegal immigration alleviates pressure at the border and upholds our values 
 citizenship act would permanently increase family sponsored and employment based immigration 
 the bipartisan border legislation would increase the number of immigrant visas that are available by         over   years 
 legal immigration pathways while we wait for congress to act  president biden has used his authority to provide orderly  legal immigration pathways for those fleeing violence  and decrease the number of illegal border crossings 
 the biden harris administration established a humanitarian parole process for cubans  haitians  nicaraguans  and venezuelans  chnv   which allows people from these four countries who have a sponsor in the u 
 and who pass a background check to come to the u 
 for a period of two years to live and work lawfully 
 border encounters from these nationalities decreased by    percent in the first six months after chnv was put in placeincentivizing migrants to stay in place  rather than make the dangerous journey to our southwest border 
 he also established new family reunification parole processes to allow eligible individuals from el salvador  guatemala  honduras  colombia  cuba and haiti to be reunited with family in the united states while they wait to complete the process for securing lawful permanent residence 
 president biden has worked closely with partners throughout the region including  most importantly  the government of mexico to undertake coordinated actions to stop the flow of migrants before they reach our border 
 and he has supported our regional partners through the la declaration process working together on coordinated enforcement  development of lawful pathways  and efforts to address the root causes of migration 
 citizenship act  congress must act to increase the number of family sponsored and employment based immigrant visas that are available each fiscal year so that people arent forced to wait decades for a visa 
 legislation should also include provisions to ensure that children who came as dependents on their parents temporary visas can remain in the united states with their families  even after turning     provisions to streamline applications of at risk afghan allies to the u 
 refugee admissions program  and a process for afghan evacuees to have their status adjusted to lawful permanent resident 
 legislation should also extend work authorization to those who utilize lawful visa pathways so that families can more quickly get on the path to economic self sufficiency 
 this includes k    k    and k   nonimmigrant visa holders  fiancs  spouses  children of u 
 citizens   and the spouses and children of high skilled temporary visa holders 
 and  democrats will explore opportunities to identify or create work permits for immigrants  long term undocumented residents  and legally processed asylum seekers in our country 
 congress should also increase the number of visas for the special immigrant juvenile status program for abused  abandoned  or neglected youth  building on actions that the administration has already taken to provide deferred action and work authorization for juveniles in this program 
 keeping families together and supporting long term undocumented individuals  including dreamers president biden also announced new actions to keep an estimated         american families together by allowing certain noncitizen spouses and children of u 
 citizens who have been in the country for    years or more to apply for lawful permanent residencea status theyre already eligible forwithout leaving the country first 
 the average beneficiary has been in the united states for more than    years  and will finally be able to come out of the shadows and fully contribute to our communities 
 congress must pass legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers  farmworkers  careworkers  and other long term undocumented individuals who contribute to this country  by paying taxes and contributing to their local economies  and in his second term  president biden will continue pressing them to do so 
 fast  efficient immigration decisions immigration officers have to make the right decisions  and they also have to make them quickly and efficiently 
 citizenship and immigration services  uscis  has cut processing times significantly for those awaiting work authorization and ensured that immigration decisions including naturalization and work permit applications are made fairly and as quickly as possible 
 as of april       the administration achieved the lowest wait time for naturalization since      and the lowest wait time for work authorization documents from certain categories of applicants since      
 in fy       uscis administered the oath of allegiance to more than         new u 
 citizens  including        members of the military  effectively eliminating the backlog of naturalization applications 
 it also reduced the median processing time for naturalization from    
 the administration has also partnered with state governments and non profit groups to host work authorization clinics  which have eased the burden on american communities by helping migrants support their families and move out of emergency shelter into more stable housing options 
 it will also help to fund community based organizations that host clinics to assist with immigration cases 
 ports of entry safer and more orderly  the administration launched cbpone  a free online tool available to migrants in parts of mexico 
 scheduling appointments makes the process at our border safer and more orderly  and the advance information that is submitted to cbp creates a more efficient and streamlined process for cbp and for individuals 
 cbpone has increased administrative processing capacity fivefold since its introduction 
 chapter eight  advancing the presidents unity agenda since the day he took office  president biden promised to be a president for all americans 
 he knows that we agree on a lot more than we disagree on 
 during his first state of the union  president biden outlined a unity agenda to make progress solving big challenges that americans have in common  beating the opioid epidemic  tackling the mental health crisis  holding big tech accountable  ending cancer as we know it  and meeting our nations sacred obligation to veterans 
 under president bidens leadership  democrats worked across the aisle to make real progress on these critical issues 
 were providing life saving treatment for opioid use disorder to end the epidemic  making historic investments in mental health care to help struggling americans  establishing new high standards for ai safety and protecting american privacy  bringing together providers  insurers  and researchers to work toward ending cancer  and passed the pact act to expand health care benefits to veterans 
 beating the opioid epidemic for too long  the scourge of opioids has torn through our communities  ripping apart families and shattering lives 
 our nations opioid epidemic impacts americans in every corner of the country  from small towns to large cities to tribal lands 
 far too many americans have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose 
 the biden harris administration is strengthening prevention  investing in treatment  and expanding recovery support services 
 the administration has increased the number of medical providers who can initiate treatment from         to   million and made historic investments in the state opioid response program to help states deliver free treatment services to over   
  million people and enabled states to reverse more than         overdoses 
 to curb opioid overdoses  the administration is making naloxone  an overdose prevention drug  available over the counter at grocery stores and pharmacies 
 they also took steps to increase access to naloxone at federal facilities  and ended a requirement for length of addiction before entering treatment 
 democrats will continue these critical investments in life saving medication and care for americans struggling with addiction and most at risk of overdose 
 investing in mental health the pandemic exacerbated feelings of sadness  isolation  and loneliness across the country and strained our health care system  including mental health services 
 president biden  vice president harris  and democrats know mental health care is health care 
 for millions of americans  that essential mental health care is out of reach 
 in       less than half of all adults with a mental illness diagnosis received care for it and its worse for kids nearly    percent of children who need mental health care cannot get it 
 thats why democrats are taking steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in america 
 the administration launched     the national suicide   crisis lifeline  which has connected nearly    million americans in crisis to immediate  confidential  and free support from trained counselors 
 and  the national maternal mental health hotline has received more than        calls and texts  to help mothers and their loved ones navigate mental health issues 
 democrats will push to expand     to handle increased capacity and serve more americans 
 at the same time  we must make it easier for all americans to access high quality mental health and substance use treatment by recruiting and training more professionals to deliver culturally and linguistically competent  high quality behavioral health care  and by strengthening coverage across all health plans 
 and we must extend workforce development and incentive programs 
 the administration is delivering    billion to hire or train        school based mental health counselors the largest investment in school based mental health in history thanks to the bipartisan safer communities act 
 and  it is delivering additional resources to support students who need mental health care 
 as mental health care becomes increasingly expensive  democrats are pushing for permanent funding for certified community behavioral health clinics  which provide      crisis care and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders  regardless of individuals ability to pay 
 and  the president is calling for additional resources to connect more americans to affordable care at work and at school 
 president biden  vice president harris  and democrats are working to ensure full mental health parity so that mental health care is covered the same as physical health care 
 were strengthening mental health parity requirements and closing insurance loopholes for the more than     million americans with private health insurance 
 and  the president is calling on congress to expand medicares coverage for mental health care  applying the same parity protections to medicare beneficiaries 
 protecting kids online  strengthening americans data privacy    promoting competition tech platforms and companies help keep us connected  inspire ideas and innovation  and create a global marketplace 
 at the same time  they collect  share  and exploit data  risk our childrens mental health  and deepen extremism and polarization 
 there is growing scientific evidence for what so many americans already know  social media and other online platforms can affect our mental health and well being particularly for our kids 
 in addition  a handful of dominant tech platforms and companies increasingly control much of the market  allowing them to exercise enormous power over americans daily lives and  too often  use that power to exclude competitors and undermine consumers and innovation 
 president biden believes that all companies  including technology companies  should be held accountable for the harm they cause 
 the president has raised the alarm that social media and other platforms have allowed abusive and even criminal conduct like cyberstalking  child sexual exploitation  and non consensual intimate images to proliferate on their sites and called on democrats and republicans to unite on legislation to address these issues 
 the surgeon general issued an advisory warning about the impacts of social media on youth mental health  noting that he cannot conclude social media is safe for children and adolescents 
 democrats will pass bipartisan legislation to protect kids privacy and to stop big tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online  ban targeted advertising to children  and put stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us 
 and  the administration has strengthened legal protections for survivors and victims of non consensual intimate imagery  including those generated by ai  building on the federal civil cause of action established under the violence against women act reauthorization of      
 president biden has also called on democrats and republicans to pass bipartisan legislation to promote competition and privacy in the tech industry 
 important policies include promoting interoperability between tech services and platforms  allowing users to control and transfer their data  and preventing large platforms from giving their own products and services an unfair advantage in the marketplace 
 we must also fundamentally reform section     of the communications decency act  which shields tech platforms from liability even when they host or disseminate violent or illegal content  to ensure that platforms take responsibility for the content they share 
 democrats are determined to strengthen data privacy 
 the president issued an executive order to protect americas sensitive personal data from commercial data brokers  identity thieves  and foreign intelligence actors 
 and  the federal trade commission is cracking down on commercial surveillance and taking on technology companies for illegally retaining childrens data 
 we must do more and update and pass the consumer privacy bill of rights  protect student data privacy by ensuring what is collected in schools is only used for education  and update the electronic communications privacy act to protect personal electronic information and safeguard location information 
 seizing the promise and managing the risks of ai artificial intelligence  ai  holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril 
 while ai is helping to cure diseases  predict the weather  and transform education  its also being used to clone voices  commit fraud  institutionalize bias  and undermine democracy 
 we need to act now and act fast to realize the promise of ai and manage its risks to ensure that ai serves the public interest 
 democrats are finding solutions to make sure that as ais capabilities grow  we can manage the implications for americans rights  safety and security 
 president biden issued a landmark executive order directing federal agencies to establish new high standards for ai safety and security  protect americans privacy  advance equity and civil rights  stand up for workers and consumers  promote competitive markets for ai development and use  and more 
 democrats are committed to ensuring that workers get a voice in how ai is used in their workplace and that they share fairly in any economic gains ai produces 
 we know that ai can deepen discrimination  bias  and other abuses in justice  health care  education  and housing 
 thats why the administration has already taken action by publishing the blueprint for an ai bill of rights and issuing new guidance from federal agencies on combating algorithmic discrimination across the economy 
 as ai becomes more prevalent  its critical we have the brightest minds working to understand new technologies 
 the administration launched an ai talent surge to accelerate hiring ai professionals across the federal government  launched a pilot program to enhance successful initiatives for training additional scientists in ai  and created the ai safety institute at the national institute of standards and technology  nist  to set rigorous standards for extensive testing of powerful ai models to ensure safety before public release 
 during president bidens second term  democrats will continue to advocate for the safe and secure development of ai 
 we will invest in the ai safety institute to create guidelines  tools  benchmarks  and best practices for evaluating dangerous capabilities and mitigating ai risk 
 we will also prioritize funding for critical ai research and development that advances ai safety 
 we will also ban voice impersonations  and president biden will take action to provide heightened protections in critical sectors such as health care  financial services  education  housing  and transportation 
 finally  we will make sure that we responsibly develop  test  procure  integrate transformative ai across the federal government 
 ending cancer as we know it cancer has touched nearly every single american family 
 as we honor the enormous courage and strength of the millions of americans facing the disease  were working to end cancer as we know it and get patients and families the quality care and support that they deserve 
 the president and first lady re launched the cancer moonshot in      to reduce the nations cancer death rate by at least half and improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer 
 the cancer moonshot has already announced more than    new programs  policies  and resources  including commitments from seven leading insurance companies to reimburse for navigation services  new actions from    comprehensive cancer centers and community oncology practices to bring effective navigation support to underserved communities  and established insurance codes so practices  including medicare providers  have a way to bill for patient navigation services 
 the administration launched the advanced research projects agency for health  arpa h   which is supercharging high impact research and development to improve american health outcomes and deliver breakthroughs on cancer 
 president biden is calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments  make drugs more affordable  and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every companys research 
 were supporting these initiatives by providing funds to essential programs for cancer research and health care like the national cancer institute  nci   fda  center of disease control  cdc   veterans affairs  va   indian health service  ihs   and arpa h 
 with a second term in office  president biden will continue to work to prevent cancer  detect it early  deliver innovation  care for families facing cancer  and  ultimately  end cancer as we know it 
 meeting our nations sacred obligation to veterans and military families president biden believes that our nation has no more sacred obligation than providing for our military service members when theyre sent into harms way and caring for them and their families after they come home 
 president biden signed into law more than    bipartisan bills addressing critical issues facing veterans  service members  and families today 
 he signed the pact act the most significant expansion of health care benefits and services for veterans in more than    years which expands va eligibility and services to veterans who were exposed to toxic substances 
 thanks to the pact act  more than         veterans and survivors are now receiving new service connected disability benefits  making care and benefits available to veterans battling over     medical conditions 
 democrats are also taking steps to support veterans mental health and decrease the scourge of veteran suicides by expanding mental health screenings  increasing access to legal and financial support  and hiring more mental health professionals at the va 
 president biden took historic action to end sexual assault and domestic violence in the military by calling for the establishment of the independent review commission on sexual assault and then implementing the commissions recommendations to better protect survivors 
 the administration will prioritize the effective implementation of the military justice improvement and increasing prevention act  including by successfully operating the offices of special trial counsel within the military services branches  and the office of the chief prosecutor of the u 
 were also taking steps to boost access to affordable and stable housing for all veterans  who often face a high risk of homelessness  with a focus on women veterans 
 last year alone  the va helped more than         veterans and their families stay in their homes and permanently housed more than        veterans 
 the administration awarded more than    billion in grant funding to help homeless veterans and house their families and launched a first of its kind funding for legal services for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness to support accessing government benefits  navigating family law  ensuring access to safe housing  and assisting with debt 
 the veteran scam and fraud evasion  vsafe  task force has cracked down on scams targeting veterans  and the new national veterans financial resource center has promoted financial stability  literacy  and debt management for veterans 
 the va is making it easier and faster for veterans to get their va medical debt forgiven 
 our commitment to our veterans and military members extends to those who care for and support them 
 thats why president biden signed an executive order to help military spouses obtain and maintain careers in the federal government 
 the department of defense and the department of state also took action to ensure military spouses can keep their federal jobs when their loved ones are stationed overseas 
 president biden has made child care more affordable and accessible for military families  and signed an executive order providing financial support for military connected caregivers 
 going forward  we will continue to implement the pact act  and we will strengthen va care by fully funding inpatient and outpatient care and long term care  and by upgrading medical facility infrastructure 
 we will also improve and increase access to mental health care  expand suicide prevention  and invest in opioid overdose prevention and treatment 
 democrats are also determined to expand women veterans health care and access to benefits  and to continue implementing key independent review commission on sexual assault recommendations 
 with a second term in office and a majority in congress  we will fulfill our promise to end veteran homelessness and support military students with disabilities 
 democrats will strengthen their support for military families by making child care more affordable and accessible  expanding job opportunities for spouses  and investing in a stipend for caregivers 
 we will also continue implementing the military spouse executive order and ensure the federal government is an employer of choice for military families 
 in recognition of our nations greatest heroes  we will expand memorial benefits to honor their years of service and lasting memories 
 chapter nine  strengthening american leadership worldwide we live in a period of significant global change 
 the world is at an inflection point between those who argue that autocracy rule by dictators or single leaders is the answer to facing todays challenges and those who understand that democracy rule by the people is essential to moving our world forward and uplifting people everywhere 
 president biden believes at this decisive moment we must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people 
 we must rally the world to address the challenges that impact all of us  from climate change and global health to human rights  technology  food security  and inclusive economic growth 
 the challenges of the current moment require us to revisit old assumptions and invest in new sources of american power 
 we have seen aggression from authoritarian powers  the destabilizing impact of a global pandemic  the growing existential danger of the climate crisis  the awesome power of emerging technologies  and the shared vulnerabilities that underlie the   st century global economy 
 most importantly  these challenges underscore how lives and livelihoods across the world are increasingly interdependent 
 for too long  american foreign policy was conducted as if our domestic challenges were disconnected from global ones 
 president biden understands that the two go hand in hand  and that leading abroad means being strong and resilient at home 
 he also knows that the united states is strongest when our partners are strong too 
 thats why he has met the challenges of his first term including the russian invasion of ukraine  the existential threat of climate change  and intense strategic competition with china by leading coalitions of nations who share our values to stand together 
 europe during president bidens first term  no region of the world has better illustrated the importance of our alliances than europe 
 when vladimir putin launched his reckless war of aggression against ukraine  he sought to shake the very foundations of the free world 
 he thought he could roll into ukraine and that ukraine and the world would roll over 
 instead  he met the determination of the ukrainian people 
 he also enhanced the resolve of nato  the greatest military alliance in the history of the world  led by the united states 
 under president bidens leadership  the united states has been steadfast in standing alongside our european allies to defend principles of sovereignty  deter further russian aggression  protect our shared values  and make critical investments to ensure the security of the united states and our transatlantic allies in the years to come 
 president biden has pursued three core objectives in ukraine  help ukraine defend its sovereignty  maintain unity in our transatlantic alliances  and prevent escalation into direct conflict with russia 
 on all three fronts  the united states has succeeded 
 under president bidens leadership  america has provided ukraine with the weapons as well as the diplomatic and economic support needed to defend its sovereignty from russian aggression 
 that work has created good paying american jobs as we build the arsenal to defend ourselves at home and help protect democracy abroad 
 alongside our allies  the united states has rallied a coalition of approximately    nations to provide much needed security assistance to ukraine and coordinated unprecedented international actions to impose tough sanctions on russia and hold putin accountable on the world stage 
 the biden harris administration has also helped protect ukraines civilian population and energy infrastructure from unprovoked russian attacks and worked to resume trade of ukrainian agricultural products to support global food security 
 under president bidens leadership  nato is stronger and more united than ever and has bolstered its ranks by adding two highly capable allies  sweden and finland 
 nato nations are meeting their financial commitments as well  with    nato countries on track to meet a spending target of   percent of gdp on defense in      up from   countries in      
 president biden has also made clear that he considers the   percent goal to be a floor not a ceiling  and he continues to press the alliance to do even more to bolster collective defenses 
 more broadly  the administration has deepened cooperation with europe to confront a range of shared challenges 
 president biden has worked with our european allies to manage competition with china  resolve disputes between america and the european union  and address long standing conflicts in the balkans and caucasus and persistent trade issues across the continent 
 the us eu trade and technology council has established rules of the road on global economic and technology issues 
 the united states and united kingdom ai safety institutes have agreed on a common approach to developing artificial intelligence safely 
 and president biden has led the development of the us eu energy council to counter the effects of russias invasion of ukraine 
 president biden has also been willing to lead where other presidents have not  becoming the first president to recognize the armenian genocide 
 the threat posed by russia transcends its war of aggression in ukraine 
 russia is enlisting north korea  iran and china in its efforts to attack freedom across the world through military equipment sales and economic partnerships 
 by strengthening our alliances in europe and indo pacific  and strengthening the connections among our allies  including by inviting our indo pacific allies to participate in the nato summits in madrid  vilnius  and washington  dc  the united states is countering russias disruptive actions no matter where they occur 
 president biden will never turn his back on our allies 
 in his second term  he will continue to stand with ukraine to stop putins atrocities and constrain russias threat to allied nations and americas vital interests 
 in addition to continuing to strengthen nato  he will help ukraine recover economically and support ongoing efforts to strengthen ukraines democracy and deepen its political and economic relationship with european and transatlantic institutions 
 president biden will continue to work closely with the eu on emerging political and economic challenges and work with our european and indo pacific allies to disrupt russias emerging military and economic alliances with iran and north korea 
 indo pacific the united states is an indo pacific power 
 the region  stretching from our pacific coastline to the indian ocean  is home to more than half of the worlds people  nearly two thirds of the worlds economy  and seven of the worlds largest militaries 
 in the years ahead  as the region drives as much as two thirds of global economic growth  its influence will only grow as will its importance to the united states 
 president biden understands that standing up for the rules of the road in the indo pacific  and standing by our allies  makes us safer 
 that is why he has maintained a commitment to freedom of navigation across the indo pacific  standing with the philippines and other allies and partners to push back against hostile actions and coercion by china 
 he also worked to expand our military presence in japan and secure access to strategic sites in the philippines through a new defense cooperation agreement steps that will help deter future regional aggression 
 across the indo pacific  president biden has prioritized strengthening key multilateral partnerships 
 he elevated the quad which brings together the democratic strength of the united states  australia  india  and japan to unleash new forms of regional cooperation on technology  climate  health  and maritime security 
 he founded aukus a partnership among the united states  united kingdom  and australia to better integrate the defense industrial bases of two of our closest allies and to produce conventionally armed  nuclear powered submarines and increase cooperation on advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence  autonomous platforms  and electronic warfare 
 under president bidens leadership  the united states hosted a historic trilateral camp david summit with japan and south korea  enshrined the washington declaration with south korea  and extended trilateral deterrence discussions with japan 
 the administration has elevated our relationships with vietnam  indonesia  and asean to comprehensive strategic partnerships 
 it has intensified our engagement with vital regional fora in the indo pacific  including hosting the leaders of the pacific islands forum and asean nations for face to face summits in washington  dc  and hosting the      apec summit in san francisco 
 president biden is also investing in a twenty first century partnership between the united states and india that builds technology into the fabric of our cooperation through programs such as the u 
 india initiative on critical and emerging technology 
 president biden has also worked alongside our allies to counter the threat posed by north koreas destabilizing development of nuclear and missile programs  in violation of multiple un security council resolutions 
 by bolstering our trilateral cooperation with south korea and japan  we are maintaining peace and stability in the korean peninsula and beyond 
 in his second term  president biden will continue to promote a free  open  connected  prosperous  secure  and resilient indo pacific 
 he will deepen economic engagement to drive inclusive growth 
 and he will continue to strengthen our traditional alliances and broaden regional partnerships to bolster deterrence and resist coercion 
 china president biden recognizes that the peoples republic of china  prc  is americas most consequential strategic competitor 
 the prc is the only global actor that combines the intention to fundamentally reshape the u 
 led international order with an increasing military  economic  diplomatic  and technological capacity to do so 
 president biden understands the imperative of rising to this challenge while managing the competition between our countries responsibly 
 president biden has invested in our strengths at home and our alliances abroad to compete vigorously with china  but we do not seek conflict 
 he has maintained a steadfast commitment to being tough but smart towards the prc  relentlessly advancing u 
 interests and values while ensuring a floor of stability in the relationship with china 
 we will make no apology in pushing back on unfair trade practices that harm american workers 
 and we will guard against china taking advantage of americas openness to use u 
 technologies against america  our allies  and our interests 
 against this backdrop  we seek to  de risk  and diversify the economic relationship between our countries  not decouple 
 we will protect a targeted number of sensitive technologies with focused restrictions  creating a  small yard and a high fence  that preserves our national security 
 president biden has taken decisive action to counter unfair economic practices by the prc and level the playing field for american workers  strategically increasing tariffs on a variety of products such as steel and aluminum  semiconductors  electric vehicles  batteries  critical minerals  solar cells  ship to shore cranes  and medical products 
 president biden also knows that for america to succeed in future competition with china  we must continue to invest in our workers and industrial base now 
 that is why he issued an executive order on outbound investment  preserving and protecting american and allied national security interests by denying china access to most advanced technologies that allow them to develop their military and surveillance capacities 
 he also tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and manufacturing equipment  as well as semiconductor  artificial intelligence  and quantum computing technologies to china  stifling their military use of these technologies 
 and in areas where it is in the interests of the united states and the world for our two nations to work together like addressing climate change and countering fentanyl trafficking the united states will do so 
 president biden pushed china to take action to curb the flow of fentanyl into the americas  as well as to commit to climate change mitigation efforts as part of a global coalition 
 in his second term  president biden will remain focused on actions at home and abroad to outcompete china 
 he will continue to stand up to unfair economic practices  restrict the prcs access to advanced technologies that could be used to harm american interests  and reshore supply chains for materials and technologies critical for the   st century 
 the administration will continue to invest in our alliances and partnerships to ensure china cannot coerce its neighbors or overturn the international rules that keep america secure and prosperous 
 president biden will also remain steadfast in americas commitment to peace and stability across the taiwan strait consistent with the u 
 one china policy guided by the taiwan relations act  the three joint communiques  and the six assurances in order to continue to ensure that there are no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side 
 even as we compete with china  the administration will continue to responsibly manage the relationship with the prc to avoid a costly spiral to conflict and seek to identify new areas where the united states and china may be able to work together  such as setting guardrails on the safe usage of artificial intelligence 
 the middle east   north africa president biden is working to build a durable peace in the middle east bolstered by regional integration  a strong coalition to counter and deter iran and prevent it and its terrorist proxies from threatening the security of the region  and a negotiated two state solution that ensures israels future as a jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own 
 the terrorist group hamas sought to destroy the promise of that vision on october          but they will not succeed 
 the united states strongly supports israel in the fight against hamas 
 and the hard work of diplomacy under the presidents leadership has made real progress on a way forward that will free the hostages  establish a durable ceasefire  ease humanitarian suffering in gaza  and make possible normalization between israel and key arab states  together with meaningful progress and a political horizon for the palestinian people 
 president biden has spent decades working to advance u 
 as president  he has met with and worked alongside every key leader in the region to de escalate conflicts  deter aggression and forge new ways to promote stability  prosperity  human security  and peace 
 president biden has long believed that partners and allies should be able to deter conflict and defend themselves in ways that safeguard human rights and prevent civilian harm 
 the administration has worked tirelessly to deepen and widen regional integration
