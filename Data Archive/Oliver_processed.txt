preambleas libertarians  we seek a world of liberty  a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and are not forced to sacrifice their values for the benefit of others 
we believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world  that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships  and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized 
consequently  we defend each persons right to engage in any activity that is peaceful and honest  and welcome the diversity that freedom brings 
 the world we seek to build is one where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways  without interference from government or any authoritarian power 
in the following pages we set forth our basic principles and enumerate various policy stands derived from those principles 
these specific policies are not our goal  however 
 our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime  and it is to this end that we take these stands 
statement of principleswe  the members of the libertarian party  challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual 
we hold that all individuals have the right to exercise sole dominion over their own lives  and have the right to live in whatever manner they choose  so long as they do not forcibly interfere with the equal right of others to live in whatever manner they choose 
governments throughout history have regularly operated on the opposite principle  that the state has the right to dispose of the lives of individuals and the fruits of their labor 
 even within the united states  all political parties other than our own grant to government the right to regulate the lives of individuals and seize the fruits of their labor without their consent 
we  on the contrary  deny the right of any government to do these things  and hold that where governments exist  they must not violate the rights of any individual  namely      the right to life accordingly we support the prohibition of the initiation of physical force against others      the right to liberty of speech and action accordingly we oppose all attempts by government to abridge the freedom of speech and press  as well as government censorship in any form  and     the right to property accordingly we oppose all government interference with private property  such as confiscation  nationalization  and eminent domain  and support the prohibition of robbery  trespass  fraud  and misrepresentation 
since governments  when instituted  must not violate individual rights  we oppose all interference by government in the areas of voluntary and contractual relations among individuals 
 people should not be forced to sacrifice their lives and property for the benefit of others 
 they should be left free by government to deal with one another as free traders  and the resultant economic system  the only one compatible with the protection of individual rights  is the free market 
 note  the statement of principles was approved at the convention in dallas in      
  personal libertyindividuals are inherently free to make choices for themselves and must accept responsibility for the consequences of the choices they make 
 our support of an individuals right to make choices in life does not mean that we necessarily approve or disapprove of those choices 
 no individual  group  or government may rightly initiate force against any other individual  group  or government 
 libertarians reject the notion that groups have inherent rights 
 we support the rights of the smallest minority  the individual 
  self ownershipindividuals own their bodies and have rights over them that other individuals  groups  and governments may not violate 
 individuals have the freedom and responsibility to decide what they knowingly and voluntarily consume  and what risks they accept to their own health  finances  safety  or life 
  expression and communicationwe support full freedom of expression and oppose government censorship  regulation  or control of communications media and technology 
 language that is perceived to be offensive to certain groups or individuals is not a cause for any legal action 
 speech that is not literally a threat of aggression or violence is not in itself aggression or violence and can never be used to justify aggression or violence 
 individuals are responsible for their own reactions to speech 
 we favor the freedom to engage in or abstain from any religious activities that do not violate the rights of others 
 we oppose government actions that either aid or attack any religion 
  privacylibertarians advocate individual privacy and government transparency 
 we are committed to ending governments practice of spying on everyone 
 we support the rights recognized by the fourth amendment to be secure in our persons  homes  property  and communications 
 protection from unreasonable search and seizure should include records held by third parties  such as email  medical  and library records 
  personal relationshipssexual orientation  preference  gender  or gender identity should have no impact on the governments treatment of individuals  such as in current marriage  child custody  adoption  immigration  or military service laws 
 government does not have the authority to define  promote  license  or restrict personal relationships  regardless of the number of participants 
 consenting adults should be free to choose their own sexual practices and personal relationships 
 until such time as the government stops its illegitimate practice of marriage licensing  such licenses must be granted to all consenting adults who apply 
  parental rightsparents  or other guardians  have the right to raise their children according to their own standards and beliefs  provided that the rights of children to be free from abuse and neglect are also protected 
  adult rights and responsibilitiesonce individuals are presumed to have adequate judgment to vote and serve on a jury or in the military  they should also be presumed to have sufficient judgment to decide their own purchase and use of alcohol  tobacco  firearms  cannabis  and engage in other activities currently restricted by government due to age 
  crime and justicegovernment force must be limited to the protection of the rights of individuals to life  liberty  and property  and governments must never be permitted to violate these rights 
 laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud  or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm 
 therefore  we favor the repeal of all laws creating crimes without victims  such as gambling  the use of drugs for medicinal or recreational purposes  and consensual transactions involving sexual services 
 we support restitution to the victim to the fullest degree possible at the expense of the criminal or the negligent wrongdoer 
 the constitutional rights of the criminally accused  including due process  a speedy trial  legal counsel  trial by jury  and the legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty  must be preserved 
 we assert the common law right of juries to judge not only the facts but also the justice of the law 
 we oppose the prosecutorial practice of over charging in criminal prosecutions so as to avoid jury trials by intimidating defendants into accepting plea bargains 
 additionally  we support the abolition of qualified immunity so that law enforcement and prosecutors would be held legally accountable for misconduct that leads to wrongful convictions or other acts of injustice 
  death penaltywe oppose the administration of the death penalty by the state 
  self defensethe only legitimate use of force is in defense of individual rights life  liberty  and justly acquired property against aggression 
 this right inheres in the individual  who may agree to be aided by any other individual or group 
 we affirm the individual right recognized by the second amendment to keep and bear arms  and oppose the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of self defense 
 private property owners should be free to establish their own conditions regarding the presence of personal defense weapons on their own property 
 we oppose all laws at any level of government restricting  registering  or monitoring the ownership  manufacture  or transfer of firearms  ammunition  or firearm accessories 
  economic libertylibertarians want all members of society to have abundant opportunities to achieve economic success 
 a free and competitive market allocates resources in the most efficient manner 
 each person has the right to offer goods and services to others on the free market 
 the only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights  adjudicate disputes  and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected 
 all efforts by government to redistribute wealth  or to control or manage trade  are improper in a free society 
  aggression  property  and contractaggression is the use  trespass against  or invasion of the borders of another persons owned resource  property  without the owners consent  or the threat thereof 
 we oppose all acts of aggression as illegitimate and unjust  whether committed by private actors or the state 
each person is the presumptive owner of his or her own body  self ownership   which right may be forfeited only as a consequence of committing an act of aggression 
 property rights in external  scarce resources are determined in accordance with the principles of original appropriation or homesteading  whereby a person becomes an owner of an unowned resource by first use and transformation   contract  whereby the owner consensually transfers ownership to another person   and rectification  whereby an owners property rights in certain resources are transferred to a victim of the owners tort  trespass  or aggression to compensate the victim  
as respect for property rights is fundamental to maintaining a free and prosperous society  it follows that the freedom to contract to obtain  retain  profit from  manage  or dispose of ones property must also be upheld 
 libertarians would free property owners from government restrictions on their rights to control and enjoy their property  as long as their choices do not harm or infringe on the rights of others 
 eminent domain  civil asset forfeiture  governmental limits on profits  governmental production mandates  and governmental controls on prices of goods and services  including wages  rents  and interest  are abridgements of such fundamental rights 
 for voluntary dealings among private entities  parties should be free to choose with whom they trade and set whatever trade terms are mutually agreeable 
  environmentcompetitive free markets and property rights stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect our environment and ecosystems 
 private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining natural resources 
 governments are unaccountable for damage done to our environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection 
 protecting the environment requires a clear definition and enforcement of individual rights and responsibilities regarding resources like land  water  air  and wildlife 
 where damages can be proven and quantified in a court of law  restitution to the injured parties must be required 
  energy and resourceswhile energy is needed to fuel a modern society  government should not be subsidizing any particular form of energy 
 we oppose all government control of energy pricing  allocation  and production 
  government finance and spendingsince all persons are entitled to keep the fruits of their labor  we oppose all government activity that consists of the forcible collection of money or goods from individuals in violation of their individual rights and strive for the eventual repeal of all taxation 
 to further that end  we call for the repeal of the income tax  the abolishment of the internal revenue service and all federal programs and services not required under the u 
 we oppose forcing employers to serve as tax collectors 
 we support any initiative to reduce or abolish any tax  and oppose any increase on any tax for any reason 
 to the extent possible  we advocate that all public services be funded or allowed to be provided in a voluntary manner 
  government debtgovernment should not incur debt  which burdens future generations without their consent 
 we support the passage of a balanced budget amendment to the u 
 constitution  provided that the budget is balanced exclusively by cutting expenditures  and not by raising taxes 
  government employeeswe favor repealing any requirement that one must join or pay dues to a union as a condition of government employment 
 we advocate replacing defined benefit pensions with defined contribution plans  as are commonly offered in the private sector  so as not to impose debt on future generations without their consent 
  money and financial marketswe favor free market banking  with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types 
 markets are not actually free unless fraud is vigorously combated 
 those who enjoy the possibility of profits must not impose risks of losses upon others  such as through government guarantees or bailouts 
 we support ending federal student loan guarantees and special treatment of student loan debt in bankruptcy proceedings 
 individuals engaged in voluntary exchange should be free to use as money any mutually agreeable commodity or item 
 we support a halt to inflationary monetary policies and unconstitutional legal tender laws 
  marketplace freedomlibertarians support free markets 
 we defend the right of individuals to form commercial enterprises based on voluntary association 
 we oppose all forms of government subsidies and bailouts to business  labor  or any other special interest 
 government should not compete with private enterprise 
  licensinglibertarians support the right of every person to earn an honest and peaceful living through the free and voluntary exchange of goods and services 
 accordingly  we oppose occupational and other licensing laws that infringe on this right or treat it as a state granted privilege 
 we encourage certifications by voluntary associations of professionals 
   sex workthe libertarian party supports the decriminalization of prostitution 
 we assert the right of consenting adults to provide sexual services to clients for compensation  and the right of clients to purchase sexual services from consenting sex workers 
   labor marketsemployment and compensation agreements between private employers and employees are outside the scope of government  and these contracts should not be encumbered by government mandated benefits or social engineering 
 we support the right of private employers and employees to choose whether or not to bargain with each other through a labor union 
 bargaining should be free of government interference  such as compulsory arbitration or imposing an obligation to bargain 
   educationeducation is best provided by the free market  achieving greater quality  accountability  and efficiency with more diversity of choice 
 recognizing that the education of children is a parental responsibility  we would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children  without interference from government 
 parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their childrens education 
   health carewe favor a free market health care system 
 medical facilities  medical providers  and medical products  including drugs  must be freely available in the marketplace without government restrictions or licenses 
 we recognize the freedom of individuals to determine the level of health insurance they want  if any   the level of health care they want  the care providers they want  the medicines and treatments they will use and all other aspects of their medical care  including end of life decisions 
 people should be free to purchase health insurance across state lines 
 we oppose governments either mandating  or restricting voluntary access to  medical treatments or procedures including vaccines 
   retirement and income securityretirement planning is the responsibility of the individual  not the government 
 libertarians would phase out the current government sponsored social security system and transition to a private voluntary system 
 the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals 
 we believe members of society will become even more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in this realm 
  securing libertyin the united states  constitutional limits on government were intended to prevent the infringement of individual rights by those in power 
 the only proper purpose of government  should it exist  is the protection of individual rights 
 the principle of non initiation of force should guide relationships between governments 
  national defensewe support the maintenance of a sufficient military to defend the united states against aggression 
 the united states should both avoid entangling alliances and abandon its attempts to act as policeman for the world 
 we oppose any form of compulsory national service 
  internal security and individual rightsindividual rights shall not be curtailed  whether based on circumstances of war  epidemic  natural disaster or emergency  or any other pretense 
 intelligence agencies that legitimately seek to preserve the security of the nation must be subject to oversight and transparency 
 we oppose the governments use of secret classifications to keep from the public information that it should have  especially that which shows that the government has violated the law 
 we oppose the use of torture and other cruel and unusual punishments  without exception 
  international affairsamerican foreign policy should emphasize peace with all nations  entangling alliances with none 
 government policies of foreign intervention including military and economic aid  tariffs  economic sanctions  and regime change 
 we recognize the right of all people to resist tyranny and defend themselves and their rights 
 we condemn the use of force  and especially the use of terrorism  against the innocent  regardless of whether such acts are committed by governments or by political or revolutionary groups 
  free trade and migrationwe support the removal of governmental impediments to free trade 
 political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries 
 economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders 
  rights and discriminationlibertarians embrace the concept that all people are born with certain inherent rights 
 we reject the idea that a natural right can ever impose an obligation upon others to fulfill that right 
 we uphold and defend the rights of every person  regardless of their race  ethnicity  or any other aspect of their identity 
 government should neither deny nor abridge any individuals human right based upon sex  wealth  ethnicity  creed  age  national origin  personal habits  political preference  or sexual orientation 
 members of private organizations retain their rights to set whatever standards of association they deem appropriate  and individuals are free to respond with ostracism  boycotts  and other free market solutions 
  representative governmentwe staunchly defend the rights to petition the government for redress of grievances and to express dissent 
 these rights are thwarted when government acts behind closed doors 
 we support election systems that are more representative of the electorate at the federal  state  and local levels  such as proportional representation  alternative voting systems  and explicit inclusion of none of the above on all ballots 
 as private voluntary groups  political parties should be free to establish their own rules for nomination procedures  primaries and conventions 
 we call for an end to any tax financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws that restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns 
 we oppose laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties  deny ballot access  gerrymander districts  or deny the voters their right to consider all alternatives 
 we advocate initiative  referendum  recall  repeal  and oppose any effort to deny these options when used as popular checks on government 
  self determinationwhenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty  it is the right of the people to alter  abolish  or withdraw from it  and to agree to such new governance  or none  as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty 
 we recognize the right to political self determination  including secession 
 exercise of this right does not require permission from others 
  omissionsin every matter  we advocate the consistent application of the principle of the non initiation of coercion  physical force  or fraud 
 our silence about any other particular government law  regulation  ordinance  directive  edict  control  regulatory agency  activity  or machination should not be construed to imply approval 
 cost of living   inflation if we really want to fight for people chasing their dreams and achieving their goals in life  the first thing we have to do is make sure we quit robbing them with inflation 
 government overspending and reckless money printing are fueling skyrocketing costs  hurting those who can least afford it 
 by slashing spending and balancing the budget  we can crush inflation and ignite a stronger  more vibrant economy that works for everyone 
 economy when the government prints trillions of dollars out of thin air  it devalues the dollar that is in your wallet  that devalues the dollar that you take to the grocery store to fill up the grocery cart  the dollars that you use to pay your rent  the dollars that you use to run your business 
 americans are struggling in an economy where the government and special interests dictate the rules 
 to end these cycles of economic crises  we must reduce government interference and let individuals decide how to spend their hard earned money  sparking real innovation 
 immigration it should be simple for those who wish to come here to work and build a better life to appear before immigration officials at an accredited port of entry  be given medical and criminal checks to assess their safety  and receive a visa allowing them to immediately find employment 
 this is a process that should take  at most  days not months or years 
 our immigration system is outdated and inefficient 
 its time to break the partisan gridlock and simplify the process so immigrants can come  work  and thrive as part of our communities 
 immigrants built america  and theyre key to its future 
 healthcare when i travel and speak with voters  one of their greatest concerns is the rising cost of healthcare for themselves and their families 
 healthcare costs have skyrocketed and much of the blame comes from the overregulation of the market  and government keeping costs high as a result 
 it starts with removing caps on hsas and removing barriers that will allow consumers to purchase health insurance across state lines 
 healthcare costs are skyrocketing due to government overreach 
 by embracing market driven options like direct primary care and reforming drug approval processes  we can lower prices and increase access 
 more choices mean lower costs  education when you create one size fits all  you create the cracks that students fall through 
 if im elected president  i advocate that federally  we end the department of education  and decentralize our education 
 to fix education  we need to cut federal involvement 
 abolish the department of education  return funds to states and taxpayers  and get the government out of student loans to drive down costs 
 war   foreign policy as the major parties become more and more war hungry  libertarians have been sounding the alarm about the unsustainable military empire since its inception 
 as president  i will end wars and bring the troops home for too long  our nation has been entangled in endless wars  leaving scars on our veterans and their families 
 its time to pivot to a foreign policy focused on peace 
 we need to end drone strikes and military interventions  and instead champion free trade and international goodwill 
 lets reclaim our role as the leader of the free world by pursuing peace and serving as a beacon of hope 
 individual choice if youre not harming someone with force  fraud  coercion  theft or violence  if youre not doing any of those bad things  your life is your life 
 your business is your business  and your property is your property 
 no government should regulate personal activities or impose harsh penalties 
 we must end the death penalty  corporate bailouts  drug criminalization  abortion restrictions before viability  and excessive employment regulations 
 the government shouldnt draft citizens  tax individuals excessively  mandate medical treatments  or censor private communication 
 criminal justice reform if elected  i will put an end to the justice departments abuses and pardon all individuals imprisoned for victimless crimes  starting with snowden  assange  and ulbricht 
 our criminal justice system is broken and needs a radical overhaul 
 from courts to prisons  we must focus on empowering people  not expanding government control 
 america imprisons a quarter of the worlds inmatesan injustice in a nation that prides itself on freedom 
 we must dismantle the prison industrial complex  end the failed war on drugs  and eliminate qualified immunity for police 
 abolishing the death penalty and ensuring police accountability are crucial steps towards a just and fair system 
 lets shift from punishment to rehabilitation and make our justice system a true beacon of freedom 
 privacy our constitution clearly states the limitations on government invasion of privacy and its time we have a president who will roll back these excesses and keep government in check 
 the worst abuses often come under the guise of safety 
 with warrantless wiretaps  fisa court abuses  and the overreaching patriot act  our freedoms are under threat 
 as president  chase will dismantle these invasive programs  restore your privacy rights  and pardon whistleblowers who reveal government misconduct 
 your liberty is worth defending  green energy nuclear power is greater than fossil fuels 
 its cleaner  safer  more efficient  and helps curb the negative effects of climate change 
 solar and wind and others also have their places too  but nuclear power is what we need to power the   st century 
 chase will transform environmental policy by slashing red tape and embracing market driven  science backed solutions 
 his plan  end wars  respect tribal sovereignty  ensure energy independence  and champion smart deregulation 
 gun rights gun control throughout our history has been used to limit the ability of vulnerable populations to defend themselves 
 i support the right of every person to defend themselves from violence and aggression 
 you deserve the right to protect yourself from violence 
 history shows that gun control has often been used to limit the ability of vulnerable groups like you to defend yourself 
 im committed to ensuring you can exercise your right to self defense  appointing judges who uphold this right  and fighting against any restrictions that undermine your safety 
 lets keep our communities secure and support your right to protection 
 term limits while i support the notion of term limits in general  i recognize it would take an amendment to the u 
 chase supports term limits for all federal officialselected or appointedto keep government fresh and accountable 
 term limits ensure new perspectives and reduce wasteful spending  while agency leaders must face regular reviews for reappointment
