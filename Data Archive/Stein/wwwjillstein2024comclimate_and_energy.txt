 Climate and Energy     Declare a climate emergency utilizing presidential powers associated with the National Emergencies Act, Defense Production Act, and the Stafford Act, and issue executive actions to expedite national and international climate action. This would release $650 billion per year to support the manufacture of renewable energy and clean transportation technology, jump-starting the Green New Deal by generating millions of good-paying union jobs that green the economy - while improving the health of workers, ecosystems and communities. It also enables the reinstatement of the crude oil export ban overturned in 2015, comparable to closing 42 coal plants. It also enables suspension of the operations of all offshore leases and reduces fossil fuel exports, imports and investments in overseas fossil fuel projects. Create an Office of Climate Mobilization to coordinate policy changes and other needed interventions to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve climate justice  Achieve 100% clean renewable energy and zero-to-negative carbon emissions by no later than 2035  Ensure all climate solutions are global in scope  Fund full climate reparations to developing nations as part of a Global Green New Deal  Reduce the size and budget of the military, as hyper-militarized foreign policy and military-dependent domestic economy are major contributors to the climate emergency, while also ensuring the military transitions to green energy  Codify and implement the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice and require all federal agencies to be trained in, and implement  the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing   Ensure a Just Transition for workers shifting from the fossil fuel and other extractive and polluting industries to alternative work of their choosing  End all forms of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry  Prioritize disadvantaged and other environmental justice communities with 60 percent of green investments and climate justice projects  Take the energy industry into public ownership using a democratic federated structure, with municipal and regional utilities  Take all railroad systems into democratic public ownership, including freight, commuter, and high-speed rail  Build an electrified coast to coast high-speed rail and local Solutionary Rail   Provide clean baseload power using responsibly sourced energy storage technologies that capture renewable energy surpluses  Fully fund and strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior and superfund site cleanup  Support a Constitutional Green amendment to guarantee the right of all people to clean air, land, and water  Invest in renewable energy infrastructure across the nation, including wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, battery and energy storage, and green hydrogen for limited uses where appropriate  Build a nationwide, publicly-owned smart electricity grid  Ban all forms of fracking, mountaintop removal, tar sands mining, and new fossil fuel infrastructure  Establish a moratorium on funding, constructing, and operating false climate solutions including carbon capture and sequestration, carbon offsets, cap and trade, biofuels, hydrogen combustion, “renewable natural gas”, waste incineration, and other forms of geoengineering  Phase out nuclear power, a dirty, dangerous, expensive, and uninsurable unneeded technology, and ensure no new nuclear energy facilities are constructed  Incentivize circular economies and zero-waste manufacturing  Invest in geothermal energy infrastructure  Prioritize energy efficiency and conservation, require new buildings to demonstrate zero emissions by 2035 and retrofit existing buildings as part of a larger plan to phase out all existing gas hookups  Subsidize installation of heat pumps to replace fossil fuels for heating and cooling  Expand and transform the American Climate Corps into a public agency that employs millions for ecosystem restoration, climate damage mitigation, and renewable energy development  Rescind toxic provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act including those that provide subsidies, direct payments, and other forms of financial assistance to the fossil fuel industry, and provisions to fast-track the Mountain Valley Pipeline  Rescind permits for the Line 3, Line 5, and Dakota Access Pipelines, and implement an immediate and permanent ban on all Liquefied Natural Gas exports and infrastructure projects  Establish a Federal commission to deliver justice for residents of Cancer Alley, including recompense for all residents impacted by decades of environmental racism  Address the crisis of contaminated water supplies with national efforts to remove lead, PFAS, and other toxins from our water
