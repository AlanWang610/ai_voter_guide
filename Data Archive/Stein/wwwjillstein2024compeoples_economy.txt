 People's Economy    
 We need an economy that works for working people, not just the wealthy and powerful. To reverse surging inequality and insecurity, we need an Economic Bill of Rights establishing the rights to a living-wage job, guaranteed livable income, housing, healthcare, childcare, lifelong education, secure retirement, utilities, healthy food and clean water, so that all of us are guaranteed the basic security for a good life that can reach our highest potential. A Jill Stein administration will:   Guarantee lifelong free public education for all institutions of learning, including trade schools and Pre-K through college and graduate school  Abolish all student debt for 43 million encumbered Americans  Increase and equalize public school funding  End the privatization of public schools  Guarantee free childcare  Reduce taxes on incomes below the real median income of $75,000 per household  Strengthen Social Security - remove the artificial cap on the Social Security tax for the wealthy, and apply the Social Security payroll tax to all income, including capital gains and dividends. Remove loopholes that allow foundations to hide wealth from taxation  Institute strongly progressive taxation for incomes and wealth, and increase the estate tax  Guarantee affordable, efficient utilities through a transition of all utilities to public not-for-profit ownership  Free high-speed internet across the U.S. with rural broadband via fiber optics  Put “too big to fail” banks into public ownership as public utilities (currently the four largest banks which own 25% of all banking assets)  Create nonprofit public state and local banking  Implement postal banking  Replace corporate trade agreements with global fair trade agreements  Prohibit finance capital from buying up single-family homes and rental housing stock  Ban corporate stock buybacks  Break up monopolies in big tech and elsewhere  Tax the ultra-wealthy and giant corporations heavily    
 “We must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.” -Louis Brandeis
