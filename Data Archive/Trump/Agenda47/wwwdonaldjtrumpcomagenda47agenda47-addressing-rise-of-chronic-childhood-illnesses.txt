 “Every year, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to treat these chronic problems rather than looking at what is causing them in the first place,” President Trump said. “Too often, our public health establishment is too close to Big Pharma—they make a lot of money, Big Pharma—big corporations, and other special interests, and does not want to ask the tough questions about what is happening to our children’s health.”  
 Every year, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to treat these chronic problems rather than looking at what is causing them in the first place. Too often, our public health establishment is too close to Big Pharma—they make a lot of money, Big Pharma—big corporations, and other special interests, and does not want to ask the tough questions about what is happening to our children’s health. If Big Pharma defrauds American patients and taxpayers or puts profits above people, they must be investigated and held accountable.  
 When I am back in the White House, I will establish a special Presidential Commission of independent minds who are not bought and paid for by Big Pharma, and I will charge them with investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illnesses. I understand Big Pharma, I believe better than anyone else. I know where they’re coming from. And then, I will ask them to publish recommendations for how every American child can have a safe and healthy childhood.
