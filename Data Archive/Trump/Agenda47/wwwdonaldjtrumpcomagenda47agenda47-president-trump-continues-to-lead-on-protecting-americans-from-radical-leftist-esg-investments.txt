 President Donald J. Trump released a new Agenda47 policy video vowing to once again ban insidious “Environmental, Social, and Governance” (ESG) investments in order to protect Americans' hard-earned savings and investments from woke financial scams. President Trump’s bold actions set the example for Republicans across the country to follow his lead in fighting ESG.  
 I'm very proud that as President, I issued a historic rule banning Wall Street and employers from pouring your 401Ks, pensions, and retirement accounts into so called ESG or Environmental, Social, and Governance investments for political reasons—strictly for political reasons. These people are sick. These poorly performing woke financial scams are radical left garbage that would never be funded on their own, and certainly never be funded on their own merits.  
 The entire ESG scheme is designed to funnel your retirement money to the maniacs on the radical left. The rule we issued under my leadership was the first ESG ban anywhere in the world. And I'm delighted that Republicans in Congress and across the country have been waking up to this threat and following my lead.  
 I will demand that funds invest your money to help you, not them, but to help you. Not to help the radical left communists, because that's exactly what they are. I will once again protect our seniors, just like I did before, from the woke left and the woke left is bad news. They destroy countries.
