 When I'm back in the White House, on Day One, we are returning to a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. America's chief interest in Eastern Europe is peace and stability. We want people to stop dying. This war should never have happened, but it is long past time to end the senseless death and destruction. The numbers are much worse than you're reading about or hearing about or than they're telling you.  
 I will provide record funding for our military just as I did four great years, if you think about what we were able to do, four great years of rebuilding our military, and we rebuilt it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And now look at what's happened. And we have no ammunition as told stupidly by our president to the world so that everybody could know it. But I will also insist that we get more for every dollar spent, because we're spending too much money foolishly and our prices are too high.
