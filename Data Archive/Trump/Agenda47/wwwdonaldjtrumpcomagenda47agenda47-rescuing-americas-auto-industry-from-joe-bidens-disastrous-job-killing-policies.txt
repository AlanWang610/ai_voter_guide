 - President Trump will once again exit the horrendously unfair Paris Climate Accords and oppose all of the radical left’s efforts for a Green New Deal that are designed to shut down the development of America’s energy resources that exceed any country’s in the world, including Russia and Saudi Arabia.  
 - Under this Act, if any foreign country imposes a tariff on American-made goods, such as cars or car parts, that is higher than the tariff imposed by the U.S. for the same goods, President Trump will have the authority to impose a reciprocal tariff of the same amount on that foreign country’s goods.  
 - Because EVs cost an average of TWICE as much as gas-powered vehicles, take longer to fully charge, and have shorter ranges, almost two-thirds of Americans prefer their next car purchase to be a gas-powered vehicle, nearly half of all car dealerships would never sell an EV, and about half of current EV owners plan to switch back to a gas-powered car.  
 - The USMCA is projected to produce $34 billion in new automotive manufacturing investments in the U.S., $23 billion in new annual purchases of U.S.-made automotive parts, and 76,000 U.S. automotive jobs with strict requirements that ensure more cars are made in AMERICAN factories by AMERICAN workers.  
 And I hope United Auto Workers is listening to this because I think you better endorse Trump because I am going to grow your business and they are destroying your business. They are absolutely destroying your business. How people can vote for you just because it’s an automatic Democrat vote. Look at how they have decimated the car industry over the years. Mexico has 32 percent of the business that we used to have. It’s ridiculous. But they didn’t do it while I was President, I can tell you that.
