 president trump unveiled his new quantum leap plan that will create a new american future and modernize communities across the country 
 by building new cities  investing in transportation  lowering the cost of living for everyone  and modernizing public spaces across the country  president trump has laid out a bold strategy to revolutionize the american standard of living 
 past generations of americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible  president trump said 
 under my leadership  we will get it back in a very big way 
 our objective will be a quantum leap in the american standard of living 
 in addition to universal baseline tariffs on most foreign goods  president trumps strategic national manufacturing initiative will reclaim our economic independence from china 
 president trump will revoke chinas most favored nation trade status and adopt a   year plan to phase out all chinese imports of essential goodseverything from electronics to steel to pharmaceuticals bringing many of those jobs back home 
 past generations of americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible 
 they pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier 
 they transformed american life with the interstate highway systemmagnificent it was 
 and they launched a vast network of satellites into orbit all around the earth 
 almost one third of the land mass of the united states is owned by the federal government 
 with just a very  very small portion of that land just a fraction  of  one half of one percentwould you believe that  we should hold a contest to charter up to    new cities and award them to the best proposals for development 
 in other words  well actually build new cities in our country again 
 these freedom cities will reopen the frontier  reignite american imagination  and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people  all hardworking families  a new shot at home ownership and in fact  the american dream 
 and china are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles for families and individuals 
 just as the united states led the automotive revolution in the last century  i want to ensure that america  not china  leads this revolution in air mobility 
 these breakthroughs can transform commerce  bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural america  and connect families and our country in new ways 
 finally  i will challenge the governors of all    states to join me in a great modernization and beautification campaigngetting rid of ugly buildings  refurbishing our parks and our public spaces  making cities and towns more livable  ensuring a pristine environment  and building towering monuments to our true american heroes 
 every year  we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to treat these chronic problems rather than looking at what is causing them in the first place  president trump said 
 too often  our public health establishment is too close to big pharmathey make a lot of money  big pharmabig corporations  and other special interests  and does not want to ask the tough questions about what is happening to our childrens health 
 every year  we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to treat these chronic problems rather than looking at what is causing them in the first place 
 too often  our public health establishment is too close to big pharmathey make a lot of money  big pharmabig corporations  and other special interests  and does not want to ask the tough questions about what is happening to our childrens health 
 if big pharma defrauds american patients and taxpayers or puts profits above people  they must be investigated and held accountable 
 when i am back in the white house  i will establish a special presidential commission of independent minds who are not bought and paid for by big pharma  and i will charge them with investigating what is causing the decades long increase in chronic illnesses 
 i understand big pharma  i believe better than anyone else 
 and then  i will ask them to publish recommendations for how every american child can have a safe and healthy childhood 
 as president  i will set a national goal of ensuring that america has the no 
   lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on earth   president trump said 
  we will not only match china we will be cheaper than china by a lot 
 and more energy will mean lower inflation that will mean more jobs 
  president trump will once again exit the horrendously unfair paris climate accords and oppose all of the radical lefts green new deal policies that are designed to shut down the development of americas abundant energy resources  which exceed any countrys in the world  including russia and saudi arabia 
 because evs cost an average of twice as much as gas powered vehicles  take longer to fully charge  and have shorter ranges  almost two thirds of americans prefer their next car purchase to be a gas powered vehicle  nearly half of all car dealerships would never sell an ev  and about half of current ev owners plan to switch back to a gas powered car 
 president trump helped finance the construction of units   and   at plant vogtle in georgia  the first new nuclear reactors to begin construction in the united states in more than    years  which will create     permanent jobs  provide electricity to   
  million american homes  and avoid    million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually 
 if america is going to dominate the world in manufacturing once again as it did when i was running things    you remember when they used to say you cant have manufacturing jobs in our country anymore 
 i said really  why  and we created hundreds of thousands of them    we must be the most affordable energy and electricity place anywhere on the planet 
 right now we have energy thats weak  substandard  and unaffordable 
 its called the green new deal    i call it the green new hoax 
 we were energy independent just three years ago 
 and yet we have many times more than any other country 
 there is no country    saudi arabia  russia  nobody    no country has what we have 
 we will develop the liquid gold that is right under our feet  including american oil and natural gas and we will also embrace nuclear  clean coal  hydropower  which is fantastic  and every other form of affordable energy to get it done 
 in the future  every manufacturing plant  every data center  every semiconductor facility and assembly line will want to be built in america 
 because were going to have the lowest cost of energy 
 this will be the place where the cost of energy is lower than anyplace else on earth  where the economy is stronger than anyplace else on earth  and where the workers are the best  brightest and most talented anywhere in the world 
 under the trump reciprocal trade act  other countries will have two choicestheyll get rid of their tariffs on us  or they will pay us hundreds of billions of dollars  and the united states will make an absolute fortune 
 there will be no more unilateral economic surrender like weve done for many many decades 
 this will especially help our great farmers in iowa and other agricultural states  and it will help our manufactures all across the nation 
 we will be knocking down barriers to american farm products  american dairy products  steeljust about everything you can think of 
 from all around the world they take advantage of us  but no more 
 as part of my plan to secure the border  on day one of my new term in office  i will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law  going forward  the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic u 
   the announcement of todays executive order follows a historical slate of hundreds of executive actions  proclamations  and presidential memorandums on border security and immigration that president trump implemented while in office to remake the immigration system in the united states for the interest of the american people  including    the purpose of the   th amendment had nothing to do with the citizenship of immigrants  let alone the citizenship of the children of illegal aliens 
 its purpose was to extend citizenship to people newly freed from slavery  whose status was left in question after the infamous case dred scott v 
   this twisting of the amendments meaning and intent has caused america to become one of the few countries in the world to extend citizenship to the children of illegal aliens even if both parents are not citizens nor even legally present in the united states  thus diluting the privileges that americans are entitled to 
 theyll be eligible for welfare  taxpayer funded healthcare  the right to vote  chain migration  and countless other government benefits  many of which will also profit the illegal alien parents 
 this policy is a reward for breaking the laws of the united states and is obviously a magnet  helping draw the flood of illegals across our borders 
 they come by the millions and millions and millions 
 they come from mental institutions  they come from jails   prisoners  some of the toughest  meanest people youll ever see 
 the united states is among the only countries in the world that says that even if neither parent is a citizen nor even lawfully in the country  their future children are automatic citizens the moment the parents trespass onto our soil 
 as has been laid out by many scholars  this current policy is based on a historical myth  and a willful misinterpretation of the law by the open borders advocates 
 my order will also end their unfair practice known as birth tourism  where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the planet squat in hotels for their last few weeks of pregnancy to illegitimately and illegally obtain us citizenship for the child  often to later exploit chain migration to jump the line and get green cards for themselves and their family members 
 its a practice thats so horrible  and so egregious  but we let it go forward 
 at least one parent will have to be a citizen or a legal resident in order to qualify 
 we will secure our borders and we will restore our sovereignty 
 starting on day one  our country will be great again 
 well have borders  well have proper education  and well put america first 
 they will use the power of the federal government to abolish zoning for single family homes  destroy your property values by building giant multifamily apartment complexes in the suburbs and even next to your houseand force your community to pay for low income housing developments right next door 
 our once great cities have become unlivable  unsanitary nightmares  surrendered to the homeless  the drug addicted  and the violent and dangerously deranged 
 we are making the many suffer for the whims of a deeply unwell few  president trump said 
 for a small fraction of what we spend upon ukraine  we could take care of every homeless veteran in america 
 when i am back in the white house  we will use every tool  lever  and authority to get the homeless off our streets 
 we want to take care of them  but they have to be off our streets 
 there is nothing compassionate about letting these individuals live in filth and squalor rather than getting them the help they need 
 the homeless have no right to turn every park and sidewalk into a place for them to squat and do drugs 
 americans should not have to step over piles of needles and waste as they walk down a street in a beautiful city 
 or at least once beautiful city because theyve changed so much over the last ten years 
 we will then open up large parcels of inexpensive land  bring in doctors  psychiatrists  social workers  and drug rehab specialists  and create tent cities where the homeless can be relocated and their problems identified 
 we will open up our cities again  make them livable and make them beautiful 
 and for those who are severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed  we will bring them back to mental institutions  where they belong  with the goal of reintegrating them back into society once they are well enough to manage 
 its a tough task  a very tough task  whats taken place on the streets  whats taken place when theyre taking so much drugs 
 we will not rest until we have ended the drug addiction crisis  president trump said 
 for three decades before my election  drug overdose deaths increased every single year 
 under my leadership  we took the drug and fentanyl crisis head on  and we achieved the first reduction in overdose deaths in more than thirty years 
 as part of this effort  there should be a federal inquiry into the soros prosecutor in austin  texas  who charged a veteran with murder for defending himself against a threat by a heavily armed member of a radical left mob 
 i will also order the department of justice to establish a task force on protecting the right to self defense  which is under siege nationwide 
 we have to reform the far left bar associations and stop the purge of conservative lawyers from major law firms 
 i will do whatever it takes to save our legal systemamong the greatest achievements of western civilizationfrom the marxist barbarians who seek to destroy it 
 i will require every federal employee to pass a new civil service test demonstrating an understanding of our constitutional limited government  president trump said 
 this will include command of due process rights  equal protection  free speech  religious liberty  federalism  the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizurei know all about that at mar a lago  dont i and all the other constitutional limits on federal power 
 in addition  i will require that all agency regulatory guidance must be posted publicly in a central database  or else be rendered null and void 
 this will effectively repeal a mountain of stealth regulations and threats that rogue bureaucrats have imposed without proper oversight 
 and i will sign a law to ban bureaucrats from taking any enforcement action based on informal guidance alone 
 for example  never again will bureaucrats be allowed to bully and pressure banks to choke off or financially de platform politically disfavored industries 
 next  i will bring the independent regulatory agencies  such as the fcc and the ftc  back under presidential authority  as the constitution demands 
 these agencies do not get to become a fourth branch of government  issuing rules and edicts all by themselves 
 we will require that they submit any regulations they are considering for white house review 
 finally  i will require every federal employee to pass a new civil service test demonstrating an understanding of our constitutional limited government 
 this will include command of due process rights  equal protection  free speech  religious liberty  federalism  the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizurei know all about that at mar a lago  dont i and all the other constitutional limits on federal power 
 and then if they have children  not only do the children get automatic citizenship  but they unlock a trove of additional government benefits flowing to illegal immigrant households 
 in the meantime  our vets suffer and our citizens suffer 
 on day one of my new administration  we will shut down this travesty and defend the wealth of hardworking middle class families 
 i will stop the outrageous abuse of parole authority 
 i will reinstate my action making illegals ineligible for public housing 
 we will terminate all work permits for illegal aliens 
 and i will demand that congress send me a bill blocking any future president from abusing his power to distribute welfare benefits in this manner 
 its all being paid for by the american taxpayer 
 like automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens  welfare is a gigantic magnet drawing people from all over the world 
 they want to feast off the sweat and savings of the american taxpayer 
 president trump will take on the radical marxist prosecutors who have abolished cash bail and refuse to charge criminals 
 president trump will direct the doj to open civil rights investigations into radical leftist prosecutors officers  such as those in chicago  los angeles  and san francisco to determine whether they have illegally engaged in race based law enforcement 
 this bill will also increase vital liability protections for officers because the democrats want to take those protections away from our police  because we want them to do their jobs  and we want them to do their jobs right 
 you cant take their protections away if youre going to have them do their jobs properly 
 second  to qualify for this new funding and all other justice department grants  i will insist that local jurisdictions return to proven common sense policing measures  such as stop and frisk very simpleyou stop them and you frisk them  strictly enforcing existing gun laws against convicted felons  cracking down on the open use of illegal drugs  and cooperating with ice to get criminal aliens off our streets and get them out of our country 
 third  we will go after the radical marxist prosecutors who are abolishing cash bail  refusing to charge crimes  and surrendering our cities to violent criminals 
 i will direct the doj to open civil rights investigations into radical left prosecutors offices  such as those in chicago  l 
  and san francisco to determine whether they have illegally engaged in race based enforcement of the law 
 i will also work with congress to give the victims of their marxist policies the right to sue local officials for harm and suffering  and it has been great that they have caused 
 if your small business is pillaged because shoplifting goes unpunished  if youre brutally attacked by a violent felon released without bail or bond  then you will be entitled to massive damages 
 we already know where these turf wars and drug dens are 
 and were going to charge them and charge the culprits with every crime that we can find 
 were going to be fair  but were going to be tough 
 we also need the death penalty for drug dealers  so important 
 they get the death penalty  watch it stop and stop quickly 
 sixth  we will end the leftist takeover of school discipline and juvenile justice 
 many of these carjackers and criminals are         and    years old 
 i will order the education and justice departments to overhaul federal standards on disciplining minors 
 so  when troubled youth are out of control  theyre out on the streets and theyre going wild  we will stop it 
 the consequences are swift  certain and strong and they will know that 
 seventh  they will protect the right of self defense everywhere it is under siege 
 your second amendment does not end at the state line 
 in addition  i will of course fully secure the border  dramatically increase interior enforcement  and wage war on the cartels 
 we have never had a border so secure as it was just two years ago 
 and now our border is the worst anywhere in the world  and possibly of all time 
 theres never been a country that allowed to happen whats happening in the united states right now  where millions of people are pouring across our borders 
 theyre all being led out so they can come into the united states 
 we will also take back our streets from the homeless  the drug addicted  and the mentally ill 
 i will discuss those plans in much more detail very soon 
 that is how i will bring back public safety to america 
 were going to make america great again and were going to make america safe again 
 for decades  weve had the very same people  such as victoria nuland and many others just like her  obsessed with pushing ukraine toward nato  not to mention the state departments support for uprisings in ukraine  president trump 
 these people have been seeking confrontation for a long time  much like the case in iraq and other parts of the world  and now  were teetering on the brink of world war iii 
 and a lot of people dont see it  but i see it  and ive been right about a lot of things 
 take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents 
 i am the president who delivers peace  and its peace through strength 
 there was a reason we had no conflict  there was a reason we didnt get into wars  because other countries respected us 
 one of the reasons i was the only president in generations who didnt start a war is that i was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of washingtons generals  bureaucrats  and the so called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict  but they dont know how to get us out 
 for decades  weve had the very same people  such as victoria nuland and many others just like her  obsessed with pushing ukraine toward nato  not to mention the state departments support for uprisings in ukraine 
 these people have been seeking confrontation for a long time  much like the case in iraq and other parts of the world  and now  were teetering on the brink of world war iii 
 and a lot of people dont see it  but i see it  and ive been right about a lot of things 
 they all say  trumps been right about everything 
 over our   years in the white house  we made incredible progress in putting the america last contingent aside and bringing the world to peaceand now  were going to complete the mission 
 the state department  pentagon  and national security establishment will be a very different place by the end of my administration 
 in fact  just into my administration itll be a very different place  and itll get things done just like i did four years ago 
 well also stop the lobbyists and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national security officials toward conflict  only to reward them when they retire with lucrative jobsgetting paid millions and millions of dollars 
 take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents 
 i am the president who delivers peace  and its peace through strength 
 there was a reason we had no conflict  there was a reason we didnt get into wars  because other countries respected us 
 i entirely built all right from the beginningrebuilt our military 
 they didnt want to mess around with the united states  and now theyre laughing at us 
 we could end the ukraine conflict in    hours with the right leadership 
 at the end of my next four years  the warmongers  and frauds  and failures in the senior ranks of our government will all be gone  and we will have a new group of competent national security officials who believe in defending americas vital interests above all else 
 under my leadership  we did more than any administration in history to combat human trafficking and to end modern day slavery  president trump said 
 in one of my first acts in office  i signed an executive order targeting transnational criminal organizations that traffic and exploit innocent people 
 i signed the frederick douglass trafficking victims prevention and protection reauthorization act  authorizing      million to fight sex and labor trafficking 
  million in the first week of its release and opened at no 
 the feature has taken the nation by storm  beating out disneys indiana jones and the dial of destiny in july  th movie ticket sales despite appearing in far fewer theaters  securing the top position in the box office for the day 
 the film which is being distributed by angel studios  was produced by mexican filmmaker eduardo verstegui and stars jim caviezel 
 verstegui who was previously appointed a member of president trumps advisory commission on hispanic prosperity and who has continuously advocated for a strong and vital bilateral relationship between the u 
 and mexico  emphasized the importance of coming together as a society to address this pernicious evil and eradicate child trafficking 
 i was thrilled to host a screening at bedminster of the important new film  sound of freedom about the power of faith in overcoming evil and in particular  the evil of child trafficking 
 we had it down to the lowest number in many years  just four years ago  and now its gone through the roof 
 even though the fake news media has tried to ignore it 
 sound of freedom has been a national sensation and a colossal success at the box office  really big numbers  everyone should see it 
 this is a very important film and very important movie and its a very important documentary all wrapped up in one 
 its really about an issue that has to be discussed 
 under my leadership  we did more than any administration in history to combat human trafficking and to end modern day slavery 
 in one of my first acts in office  i signed an executive order targeting transnational criminal organizations that traffic and exploit innocent people 
 i signed the frederick douglass trafficking victims prevention and protection reauthorization act  authorizing      million to fight sex and labor trafficking 
 i signed legislation to crack down on foreign countries who are not meeting standards for eliminating trafficking  of which there are many 
 i also signed into law the abolish human trafficking act  which strengthened programs supporting survivors and provided more resources for ending modern slavery 
 we do have modern slavery  if you can believe it 
 additionally  i created the first ever white house position focused solely on combating human trafficking and perhaps most importantly  we created the most secure border in us history by far  dealing a major blow to the cartels and traffickers 
 we never had anything like it  and then i got mexico free of charge  to give us        soldiers to protect us from people coming into our country illegally 
 i will use title    to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries and without delay  and i will urge congress to ensure that anyone caught trafficking children across our border receives the death penalty immediately and that includes also for women  because women as you know are number one in trafficking 
 trump released a new agenda   policy video vowing to once again ban insidious environmental  social  and governance  esg  investments in order to protect americans hard earned savings and investments from woke financial scams 
 president trumps bold actions set the example for republicans across the country to follow his lead in fighting esg 
 im very proud that as president  i issued a historic rule banning wall street and employers from pouring your    ks  pensions  and retirement accounts into so called esg or environmental  social  and governance investments for political reasonsstrictly for political reasons 
 these poorly performing woke financial scams are radical left garbage that would never be funded on their own  and certainly never be funded on their own merits 
 the entire esg scheme is designed to funnel your retirement money to the maniacs on the radical left 
 the rule we issued under my leadership was the first esg ban anywhere in the world 
 and im delighted that republicans in congress and across the country have been waking up to this threat and following my lead 
 i will demand that funds invest your money to help you  not them  but to help you 
 not to help the radical left communists  because thats exactly what they are 
 i will once again protect our seniors  just like i did before  from the woke left and the woke left is bad news 
 this great undertaking will also help restore hope and aspiration to americas young people  instead of being irrationally terrified by political predictions of climate apocalypse 
 instead of toiling  for low wages or left wing make work projects  i have a vision that will give young americans a chance to find real meaning and work once again  like we had it two and a half years ago  building the backbone of america that is powerful  prosperous  productive  vigorous  modern  independent  and free 
 as you know  china paid hundreds of billions of dollars to the united states when i was president 
 no other president got ten cents  check it out  not even ten cents 
 i will deploy a team of warrior lawyers to hunt down every unnecessary regulation in the federal registry that hampers domestic production 
 and we will rapidly issue approvals for all worthy energy infrastructure projects with a focus on maximum speed to bring prices down rapidly 
 so  get those proposals ready now  because we are going to put thousands of americans to work building the power plants  pipelines  grids  ports  refineries  and shipping terminals of tomorrow 
 we are going to have very inexpensive energy again  like we did just two and a half years ago 
 this great undertaking will also help restore hope and aspiration to americas young people  instead of being irrationally terrified by political predictions of climate apocalypse 
 instead of toiling  for low wages or left wing make work projects  i have a vision that will give young americans a chance to find real meaning and work once again  like we had it two and a half years ago  building the backbone of america that is powerful  prosperous  productive  vigorous  modern  independent  and free 
 second  we will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus  and there are plenty of them 
 the departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled so that faceless bureaucrats will never again be able to target and persecute conservatives  christians  or the lefts political enemies  which theyre doing now at a level that nobody can believe even possible 
 seventh  i will ask congress to establish an independent auditing system to continually monitor our intelligence agencies to ensure they are not spying on our citizens or running disinformation campaigns against the american people  or that they are not spying on someones campaign like they spied on my campaign 
 eighth  we will continue the effort launched by the trump administration to move parts of the sprawling federal bureaucracy to new locations outside the washington swamp 
 just as i moved the bureau of land management to colorado  as many as         government positions can be moved out 
 and i mean immediately out of washington to places filled with patriots who love america  and they really do love america 
 ninth  i will work to ban federal bureaucrats from taking jobs at the companies they deal with and that they regulate 
 so they deal with these companies and they regulate these companies and then they want to take jobs from these companies 
 doesnt work that waysuch a public display cannot go on and its taking place all the time  like with big pharma 
 under the trump tax cuts  we allowed families to use     education savings accounts to spend up to         a year tax free on tuition for grades k through    
 this was a tremendous win for school choice    very important  school choice  remember that term and yet  that benefit did not apply to homeschoolers 
 president trump supports the right of parents to know what their children are being taught in the classroom  to be able to openly communicate any of their concerns with teachers and principals  to protect the privacy of their children  to be made aware of changing academic standards  to be updated on any acts of violence occurring at school  to inspect professional development materials  to be notified before an out of school guest speaks in class or at a school event  to review the budget and spending of their childrens school  to know if a school employee is working to address bullying or mental health concerns  including drug use or weapon use   to consent to all student surveys related to health  to have the right to opt out of school healthcare services  and to be immediately notified if a teacher or other school employee has worked to change their childrens name  pronouns  or understanding of his or her gender 
 president trump will also inform states and school districts that if any teacher or school official suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body  they will be faced with severe consequencesincluding potential civil rights violations for sex discrimination and the elimination of federal funding 
 a      study from the university of north carolina school of education found that efforts to recruit and retain high performing principals are likely to have large payoffs 
 a study by the national association of secondary school principals showed that school leadership is second only to classroom instruction as an influence on student learningor as another study from stronge   associates educational consulting put it   there is no high performing school without an effective principal principal leadership matters 
 to reward good teachers  president trump will implement funding preferences and favorable treatment for states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure for grades k     adopt merit pay to reward good teachers  and give parents the right to vote for the principals who direct their childrens education 
 president trump will get critical race theory  transgender ideology  and left wing indoctrination out of our schoolsand he will get reading  writing  and arithmetic back in  so that americas young people have the knowledge  skills  and training they need to get a great job and lead a successful career 
 just as he did during his first term  president trump will fight for patriotic education in americas schools 
 notwithstanding that americas founding principles of liberty and equality have successfully guided the united states throughout the most difficult periods in its historyincluding the long struggle to abolish slavery  our victories over fascism and communism  the advancement of civil rights for all  and the expansion of material prosperity to more people of every background in a remarkably short period of timedecades of poor scholarship have vilified our founders and the principles that they championed and have taught many of our young people to hate their own country 
 but as americas history has shown  the path to a restored and strengthened unity can be found through the rediscovery of a shared national identity rooted in our founding principles and an appreciation of our wonderful american heroes 
 president trump will ensure our children know the truth about the american founding  learn the stories of our remarkable heroes  discover the glories of western civilization  and come to appreciate the united states as the freest  most prosperous  and most virtuous nation in the history of the world 
 just as he did during his first term  president trump will ensure that to receive federal funds  local educational agencies must confirm that their policies do not prevent or interfere with constitutionally protected rights 
 president trumps guidance streamlined students ability to file a complaint if their rights were being violated and guaranteed that students could read religious texts or pray during recess and other non instructional periods 
 greatness in the classroom requires safety in the classroom 
 to that end  president trump will completely overhaul federal standards on school discipline to get out of control troublemakers out of the classroom and into reform schools and corrections facilities  for the good of themselves and their peers alike 
 this will include supporting immediate expulsion for any student who harms a teacher or another student 
 president trump will end the leftist takeover of school discipline and the juvenile system 
 he will order the departments of justice and education to overhaul federal standards on disciplining minors to get violent thugs out of our childrens classrooms so they can get the professional help they need 
 when troubled youth are out of control  the consequences must be swift  certain  and strong 
 to further harden our schools against harm from outside intruders  president trump will support federal funding to hire veterans  retired police officers  and other trained gunowners as armed guards in our nations schoolsa measure that will help deter unhinged maniacs and keep our nations children out of harms way 
 as he previously announced  president trump will direct the u 
 food and drug administration to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression  aggression  and violence 
 he will also look at whether common psychiatric drugs  as well as genetically engineered cannabis and other narcotics  are causing psychotic breaks 
 americas students are more successful  more engaged  and more prepared for real world experience when their education involves hands on projects that aim to approximate what real world work situations will demand of them 
 president trump will support project based learning inside the classroom to help train students for fulfilling work outside the classroom 
 harvard universitys graduate school of education defines project based learning as a way to develop deep conceptual understanding of abstract concepts by seeing how those concepts actually operate in the real worldbecause in order to be successful  students need to do more than just read textbooks or listen in lecture halls 
 for many students  the path to a great job is a great internship or part time work 
 for that reason  president trump will implement funding preferences for schools that actively work to help students secure internships  part time work  and summer jobs that will set them on the path to long and fulfilling careers 
 according to a report published by mdrc  a long term study of high school career academies  which combined technicalcareer education with an academic curriculum and provided some students with internships with local employers  found that these programs had large  positive impacts on students labor market outcomes eight years later 
 another education model that prioritizes meaningful work experience is cristo rey   a catholic school network that delivers a career focused  college preparatory education in the catholic tradition for students with limited economic resources  uniquely integrating rigorous academic curricula with four years of professional work experience and support to and through college 
 as education policy analyst and former senior manhattan institute fellow charles upton sahm observed of the cristo rey models work study program  it operates  in essence  like a small employment agencywith firms contracting with cristo rey to staff entry level jobs with each student working five days a month in addition to their schoolwork 
 the program  sahm wrote  helps students build impressive credentials and contacts as well as develop their confidence and self worth 
 according to the national career development association  ncda   school counselors can play a vital role in helping students identify their lifes purpose 
 having a purpose  ncda finds  can be highly motivating and encourage students to develop skills and persistence towards meaningful education  life  and career goals 
 the american school counselor association school found that high school and college counselors improve their service to their students when they understand  career technical education  cte   offers numerous benefits  including rigorous programs of study  academic and cte curriculum and productive relationships within the business community 
 these advantages serve as effective means that school counselors can use to help all students make informed career decisions 
 the trump administration restored state and local control of education by faithfully implementing the every student succeeds act  which prohibits the u 
 department of education from attempting to influence  incentivize  or coerce a state to adopt the common core state standards or any other academic standards common to a significant number of states 
 in       president trump created the      commission to better enable a rising generation to understand the history and principles of the founding of the united states in       and  through this  form a more perfect union 
 and in january       the commission released the      report   which calls for the nation to renew the pride and gratitude we have for this incredible nation that we are blessed to call home and concludes by noting that  w hen we appreciate america for what she truly is  we know that our declaration is worth preserving  our constitution worth defending  our fellow citizens worth loving  and our country worth fighting for 
 president trump signed an executive order ensuring that public universities protect first amendment rights or lose funding  addressing student debt by requiring colleges to share a portion of the financial risk  and increasing transparency by requiring universities to disclose information about the value of potential educational programs 
 the united states spends more money on education than any other country in the world 
 in total  american society pours more than a trillion dollars a year into public education systems 
 but instead of being at the top of the list  we are literally right smack    guess what     at the bottom 
 rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial  sexual  and political material  which is what were doing now  our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work  and in life and the world of keeping our country strong  so they can grow up to be happy  prosperous  and independent citizens 
 ninth  we will strive to give all students access to internships and work experiences that can set them on a path to their first job 
 but we want our children to have a great life and be successful 
 and one other thing ill be doing very early in the administration is closing up the department of education in washington d 
 and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states 
 we want them to run the education of our children  because theyll do a much better job of it 
 we spend more money per pupil  by three times  than any other nation 
 were going to end education coming out of washington d 
 were going to close it up    all those buildings all over the place and yet people that in many cases hate our children 
 there must also be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire globalist neo con establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars  pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad  while they turn us into a third world country and a third world dictatorship right here at home 
 the state department  the defense bureaucracy  the intelligence services  and all the rest need to be completely overhauled and reconstituted to fire the deep staters and put america first 
 in addition  there must also be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire globalist neo con establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars  pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad  while they turn us into a third world country and a third world dictatorship right here at home 
 the state department  the defense bureaucracy  the intelligence services  and all the rest need to be completely overhauled and reconstituted to fire the deep staters and put america first 
 finally  we have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally reevaluating natos purpose and natos mission 
 our foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict with a nuclear armed russia based on the lie that russia represents our greatest threat 
 but the greatest threat to western civilization today is not russia 
 its probably  more than anything else  ourselves and some of the horrible  u 
 its the destruction of the rule of law from within 
 its the collapse of the nuclear family and fertility rates  like nobody can believe is happening 
 its the marxists who would have us become a godless nation worshipping at the altar of race  and gender  and environment 
 and its the globalist class that has made us totally dependent on china and other foreign countries that basically hate us 
 these globalists want to squander all of americas strength  blood and treasure  chasing monsters and phantoms overseaswhile keeping us distracted from the havoc theyre creating right here at home 
 these forces are doing more damage to america than russia and china could ever have dreamed 
 evicting the sick and corrupt establishment is the monumental task for the next president 
 for many years  tuition costs at colleges and universities have been exploding  and i mean absolutely exploding while academics have been obsessed with indoctrinating americas youth   president trump said 
  the time has come to reclaim our once great educational institutions from the radical left  and we will do that 
 he will impose real standards on american colleges and universities  to include defending the american tradition and western civilization  protecting free speech  eliminating wasteful administrative positions that drive up costs  removing all dei bureaucrats  offering options for accelerated and low cost degrees  providing meaningful job placement and career services  and implementing college entrance and exit exams to prove that students are getting their moneys worth 
 once back in the white house  president trump will direct the department of justice to pursue federal civil rights cases against schools that continue to engage in racial discrimination and will advance a measure to have schools that continue these illegal and unjust policies fined up to the entire amount of their endowment 
 these standards will include defending the american tradition and western civilization  protecting free speech  eliminating wasteful administrative positions that drive up costs incredibly  removing all marxist diversity  equity  and inclusion bureaucrats  offering options for accelerated and low cost degrees  providing meaningful job placement and career services  and implementing college entrance and exit exams to prove that students are actually learning and getting their moneys worth 
 furthermore  i will direct the department of justice to pursue federal civil rights cases against schools that continue to engage in racial discrimination 
 and schools that persist in explicit unlawful discrimination under the guise of equity will not only have their endowment taxed  but through budget reconciliation  i will advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment 
 a portion of the seized funds will then be used as restitution for victims of these illegal and unjust policies  policies that hurt our country so badly 
 colleges have gotten hundreds of billions of dollars from hard working taxpayers and now we are going to get this anti american insanity out of our institutions once and for all

 colleges have gotten hundreds of billions of dollars from hard working taxpayers and now we are going to get this anti american insanity out of our institutions once and for all 
 when im back in the white house  on day one  we are returning to a foreign policy that puts americas interests first 
 americas chief interest in eastern europe is peace and stability 
 this war should never have happened  but it is long past time to end the senseless death and destruction 
 the numbers are much worse than youre reading about or hearing about or than theyre telling you 
 i will provide record funding for our military just as i did four great years  if you think about what we were able to do  four great years of rebuilding our military  and we rebuilt it bigger and better and stronger than ever before 
 and we have no ammunition as told stupidly by our president to the world so that everybody could know it 
 but i will also insist that we get more for every dollar spent  because were spending too much money foolishly and our prices are too high 
   president trump will once again exit the horrendously unfair paris climate accords and oppose all of the radical lefts efforts for a green new deal that are designed to shut down the development of americas energy resources that exceed any countrys in the world  including russia and saudi arabia 
   under this act  if any foreign country imposes a tariff on american made goods  such as cars or car parts  that is higher than the tariff imposed by the u 
 for the same goods  president trump will have the authority to impose a reciprocal tariff of the same amount on that foreign countrys goods 
   because evs cost an average of twice as much as gas powered vehicles  take longer to fully charge  and have shorter ranges  almost two thirds of americans prefer their next car purchase to be a gas powered vehicle  nearly half of all car dealerships would never sell an ev  and about half of current ev owners plan to switch back to a gas powered car 
   the usmca is projected to produce     billion in new automotive manufacturing investments in the u 
 automotive jobs with strict requirements that ensure more cars are made in american factories by american workers 
 and i hope united auto workers is listening to this because i think you better endorse trump because i am going to grow your business and they are destroying your business 
 how people can vote for you just because its an automatic democrat vote 
 look at how they have decimated the car industry over the years 
 mexico has    percent of the business that we used to have 
 but they didnt do it while i was president  i can tell you that 
   the eo required federal agencies to buy american by facilitating the domestic production of medicines and medical devices that the fda determined essential to public health 
 it did so by requiring federal agencies to buy medicines and medical devices that are entirely produced in the united states 
 trade representative to modify our international trade agreements so that drugs deemed essential to public health by the fda can no longer be purchased by federal agencies from any of the     countries that has a trade agreement with the u 
 that authorizes the manufacture of such essential drugs for the u 
   with federal agencies still permitted under current law to purchase medicines essential to public health from any of americas     trading partners  there is no incentive for federal agencies to buy from domestic companies 
 as a result  the united states will continue to be dependent on foreign countries for its most critical medical needs 
 theres currently a shortage of at least    critical cancer drugs in the united states 
 and every month of delay  cancer treatment increases the risk of death by at least     
 its unthinkable that this could be happening in the united states of america in      
 we are becoming a third world country very rapidly between our open borders and our bad elections 
 instead of treating everyone equally  making decisions based on merit or qualifications  equity means that benefits are awarded and policies are enforced based on skin color and sexual identity 
 its a catch all term used by the radical left to justify every one of its crazy programs 
 climate change is now about fighting environmental racism 
 they falsely accuse law enforcement of racism to explain why they must end cash bail instead of busting up bloodthirsty gangs that kill people all over our cities 
 in recent weeks  americans have been horrified to see students and faculty at harvard and other once respected universities expressing support for the savages and jihadists who attacked israel 
 we spend more money on higher education than any other country  and yet theyre turning our students into communists and terrorists and sympathizers of many  many different dimensions we cant let this happen 
 its time to offer something dramatically different 
 its mission will be to make a truly world class education available to every american  free of charge  and do it without adding a single dime to the federal debt 
 this institution will gather an entire universe of the highest quality educational content  covering the full spectrum of human knowledge and skills  and make that material available to every american citizen online for free 
 whether you want lectures or an ancient history or an introduction to financial accounting  or training in a skilled trade  the goal will be to deliver it and get it done properly  using study groups  mentors  industry partnerships  and the latest breakthrough in computing 
 this will be a truly top tier education option for the people 
 most importantly  the american academy will compete directly with the existing and very costly four year university system by granting students degree credentials that the u 
 government and all federal contractors will henceforth recognize 
 the academy will award the full and complete equivalent of a bachelors degree 
 in addition to help the    million americans who have some college education but no degree  the american academy will grant credit for past coursework at legacy institutions and give you the chance to complete your education at the american academy for free and much more quickly than is now possible or available 
 very simply  this meant that if congress provided more funding than was needed to run the government  the president could refuse to waste the extra funds  and instead return the money to the general treasury and maybe even lower your taxes  although we did give you the biggest tax reduction in history  and the biggest regulation reduction in history  two things i am very proud of 
    in defense of the presidents impoundment power against attacks from congress  joseph sneed  deputy attorney general under president richard nixon  explained that the use of executive impoundment to promote fiscal stability is not usurpation  rather it is in the great tradition of checks and balances upon which our constitution is based 
   in his third annual message to congress explaining why he had not purchased the gunboats as authorized by congress  president jefferson declared that a favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary 
 president jefferson used his power as the chief executive to impound congressionally appropriated funds based on his foreign policy and national security judgment that the use of the funds would be unwise and unnecessary 
 of course  this will not include national defense and  unlike ron desanctimonious  who doesnt really know what is happening  i will not lay a finger on medicare or social security 
 he wants to destroy social security and basically obliterate medicare 
 we are not going to let ron desanctus do anything to hurt medicare or social security 
 we had it done and then covid came in and we had to do some things to help save our country 
 we were going to be taking in massive amounts of money from the liquid gold that we have under our feet 
 and we were going to reduce taxes and pay off debt 
 three years from now  the united states will celebrate the biggest and most important milestone in our countrys history        years of american independence  president trump said 
 thats why as a nation  we should be preparing for the most spectacular birthday party 
 offering an inspiring and unifying vision of a successful american future  this plan builds on president trumps longstanding commitment to honor our nations    th anniversary and offers americans from every state in the union the chance to come together and share innovative visions for a successful american future    in his      salute to america independence day remarks   president trump stated  two hundred and forty four years ago in philadelphia  the    signers of our declaration of independence pledged their lives  their fortunes  and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth  that we are all made equal by god 
   in his remarks at mount rushmore on july          president trump noted   our founders launched not only a revolution in government  but a revolution in the pursuit of justice  equality  liberty  and prosperity it was all made possible by the courage of    patriots who gathered in philadelphia     years ago and signed the declaration of independence 
 they enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said  all men are created equal 
  three years from now  the united states will celebrate the biggest and most important milestone in our countrys history        years of american independence 
 but thats why as a nation  we should be preparing for the most spectacular birthday party 
 here is my plan to give americas founding in      the incredible anniversary it truly deserves 
 on day one  i will convene a white house task force called salute to america     
 it will be responsible for coordinating with state and local governments to ensure not just one day of celebration  but an entire year of festivities across the nation starting on memorial day      and continuing through july  th       
 second  i will work with all    governors  republican and democrat alike  to create the great american state fair  a unique one year exhibition featuring pavilions from all fifty states 
 the great american state fair will showcase the glory of every state in the union  promote pride in our history  and put forth innovative visions for americas future 
 third  alongside the great american state fair  we will host major sporting contests for high school athletes 
 these are great athletes  wonderful athletes from fantastic high schools all around the country 
 these patriot games will allow young americans from every state to show off the best of american skill  sportsmanship  and competitive spirit 
 and finally  and most importantly  i ask americas great religious communities to pray for our nation and our people as we prepare for this momentous occasion 
 from the very beginning  america has been a country sustained and strengthened by prayer and by our communities of faith 
 as we chart a course toward the next     years  let us come together and rededicate ourselves as one nation under god 
 far more illegal immigrants have entered the united states in the last two years than at any time in american history  and by a massive margin 
 days ago         illegal aliens were encountered crossing the border in a single    hour period 
 a colossal migrant caravan recently poured across the rio grande and into the streets of el paso  texas 
 and the people  and the police  didnt know what to do about it 
 in response to the stunning revelations from the  twitter files   president donald j 
 trump released a new video calling for an immediate investigation into the disturbing relationship between big tech platforms and government agencies  including the coordination of a massive censorship  surveillance  and propaganda campaign against the american people 
 but the censorship of the laptop from hell is only the beginning of the story about the weaponization of government against free speech 
 as recent reporting shows  the fbi and other rogue agencies have been systematically colluding with former national security officials placed in high positions at twitter  and very likely other companies  to advance their censorship regime  which is really in this case to steal an election 
 the twitter files prove that we urgently need my plan to dismantle the illegal censorship regime a regime like nobodys ever seen in the history of our country or most other countries for that matter 
 to prosecute the perpetrators for their crimes  and to restore free speech for all americans so important 
 we need a free press  we need free speech  we need fair elections  and we need borders 
 the revelations also highlight why my proposal to end the revolving door between the deep state and there is a deep state indeed 
 i wasnt a believer  but everybodys a believer right now and the tech tyrants is so important 
 there must be a   year cooling off period before any employee of these powerful agencies is allowed to take a job at a major platform 
 we must be able to defend our homeland  our allies  and our military assets around the world from the threat of hypersonic missiles  no matter where they are launched from 
 just as president trump rebuilt our military  president trump will build a state of the art next generation missile defense shield to defend america from missile attack 
 if you take a look right now  the nuclear word is being mentioned all the time 
 it was never used during the trump administration  but now other countries are using that word against us because they have no respect for our leadership 
 world war three would be a catastrophe unlike any other 
 this would make world war one and world war two like very small battles 
 to this end  when i am commander in chiefwhich we did an awfully good job at rebuilding our military 
 we rebuilt the entire militaryonce again  i will work with congress and our great military leaders 
 not the ones you see on television  i dont consider them leaders 
 were going to work with them to build a state of the art next generation missile defense shield 
 just as israel is now protected by the iron dome  a dream once thought impossible  america must have an impenetrable dome to protect our people 
 they relied on us  not just them  they relied on us 
 we have technology thats unsurpassed but our past leaders havent really wanted to use it 
 i rebuilt our military at a level that nobody thought possible  but we have to now go that further step 
 we must be able to defend our homeland  our allies  and our military assets around the world from the threat of hypersonic missilesno matter where they are launched from 
 just as i rebuilt our military  especially our nuclear capabilities  i will build the shield to defend america from missile attack 
 and thats what we had  and we had no wars during the trump administration 
 because we were strong  the other side knew it  and they didnt want to play games  they didnt want to mess around 
 trump released a new policy video today highlighting chinas intrusive actions to own americas infrastructure and vital industries 
 under president trumps bold plan  we will enact new and aggressive regulations to prevent america from falling under chinese control 
 the united states will also pressure the chinese to sell off any current holdings that threaten the countrys national and economic security 
 to protect our country  we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the united states  including energy  technology  telecommunications  farmland  natural resources  medical supplies  and other strategic national assets  president trump said 
 when im president  i will ensure that americas future remains firmly in american hands just as i did when i was president before 
 while corrupt democrats and rino type politicians in washington have been spending trillions of dollars on the green new deal nonsense  foolish foreign wars  and providing lavish benefits to illegal aliens from all over the planet  china has been spending trillions of dollars to take over the crown jewels of the u 
 as i have long said  economic security is national security 
 china does not allow american companies to take over their critical infrastructureand america should not allow china to take over our critical infrastructure 
 i didnt allow it when i was president  and i wont allow it when we become president again 
 to protect our country  we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the united states  including energy  technology  telecommunications  farmland  natural resources  medical supplies  and other strategic national assets 
 we should stop all future chinese purchases in these essential industries 
 and we should begin the process of forcing the chinese to sell any current holdings that put our national security at risk 
 and im telling you  you shouldnt pay those dues 
 you should not pay your dues because theyre selling you to hell 
 i said if you go to mexico  im putting a big tariff 
 youll make a car youre going to have a     tariff if you send that car back into the united states 
 well  right now theyre doing it again  worse than ever before 
 we lost     of our industry to mexico prior to my getting there 
 direct the department of education to inform states and school districts that if any teacher or school official suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body  they will be faced with severe consequences   including  potential civil rights violations for sex discrimination  and the elimination of federal funding  
 i will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age 
 i will then ask congress to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures  and pass a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all    states 
 the department of justice will investigate big pharma and the big hospital networks to determine whether they have deliberately covered up horrific long term side  effects of sex transitions in order to get rich at the expense of vulnerable patients 
 we will also investigate whether big pharma or others have illegally marketed hormones and puberty blockers  which are in no way licensed or approved for this use 
 my department of education will inform states and school districts that if any teacher or school official suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body  they will be faced with severe consequences  including potential civil rights violations for sex discrimination  and the elimination of federal funding 
 i will ask congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the united states government are male and femaleand they are assigned at birth 
 the bill will also make clear that title nine prohibits men from participating in womens sports 
 and we will protect the rights of parents from being forced to allow their minor child to assume a gender  which is new  and an identity without the parents consent 
 president trump today announced his plan to save american education 
 his vision will take back control from the radical left maniacs indoctrinating our children  and give our kids the high quality  pro american education they deserve  cut federal funding for any school or program pushing critical race theory  gender ideology  or other inappropriate racial  sexual  or political content on our children 
 direct the departments of justice and education to open civil rights investigations into any school district that has engaged in race based discrimination  including discrimination against asian americans 
 because the marxism being taught in schools is aggressively hostile to judeo christian teachings  aggressively pursue potential violations of the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the constitution 
 find and remove the radicals who have infiltrated the federal department of education   and get to congress reaffirm the presidents ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job 
 veto the sinister effort to weaponize civics education 
 create a new credentialing body to certify teachers who embrace patriotic values   and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children  but to educate them 
 implement massive funding preferences and favorable treatment for all states and school districts that make the following historic reforms in education  abolish teacher tenure for grades k through    and adopt merit pay  
 drastically cut number of school administrators   including the dei bureaucracy 
 adopt a parental bill of rights that includes complete curriculum transparency   and a form of universal school choice  
 implement the direct election of school principals by the parents  as the ultimate form of local control 
  the marxism being preached in our schools is also totally hostile to judeo christian teachings  and in many ways  it is resembling an established new religion 
 for this reason  my administration will aggressively pursue potential violations of the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the constitution 
 i will veto the sinister effort to weaponize civics education 
 and we will create a new credentialing body that will be the gold standard  anywhere in the world  to certify teachers who embrace patriotic values  support our way of life  and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children  but very simply to educate them 
 finally  i will implement massive funding preferences and favorable treatment for all states and school districts that make the following historic reforms in education  one  abolish teacher tenure for grades k through     so we can remove bad teachers  and adopt merit pay to reward good teachers 
 two  drastically cut the bloated number of school administrators  including the costly  divisive  and unnecessary diversity  equity  and inclusion bureaucracy 
 three  adopt a parental bill of rights that includes complete curriculum transparency  and a form of universal school choice 
 and four  implement the direct election of school principals by the parents 
 more than anyone else  parents know what their children need 
 if any principal is not getting the job done  the parents should be able to vote to fire them and select someone who will 
 our country has frankly never had anything like it  or lets say for at least the last fifty years 
 we spend more per pupil than any nation in the world by double 
 we are going to keep spending our money  but we are now going to get our moneys worth 
 we are at the end of every list on education  and yet we spend the most 
 we may spend the most  but we are going to be tops in education no matter where you go anywhere in the world 
 through these unsustainable losses  we are handing china more and more of our jobs  more and more victories  and long term prosperity in exchange for cheap  disposable consumer goods 
 we foolishly send china hundreds of billions of dollars and china uses those dollars to buy up our real estate  our factories  and our wealth creating industries 
 under my policies  we had virtually no inflation 
 we had rapid wage growth for the first time in many  many years 
 and we had more than        new factories open up for business right here in the usa 
 through my strategic national manufacturing initiative  we will do it again 
 well be bigger and better and stronger than weve ever been 
 as president  i took the most dramatic action of any administration to curtail chinas ability to conduct espionage in the united states  president trump said 
 and when im back in the white house  those efforts will be expanded in a very  very big way 
 instead of hunting down republicans  a reformed fbi and justice department will be hunting down chinese spies 
 when president trump is back in the white house  he will kick chinese intelligence operations out of the country and force china to give up any u 
 a strong signal must be sent that america will not allow china to trample our sovereignty and illegally surveil our country 
 the fbi even recently admitted that china operates a secret police force on american soil  how do you like that one  imposing the iron fist of the communist party  the rule think of this  the communist party rule on chinese nationals in the united states 
 we will shut that downand we will shut it down cold 
 agenda    read the official      republican party platform here president trumps    core promises to make america great again    seal the border and stop the migrant invasion   carry out the largest deportation operation in american history   end inflation  and make america affordable again   make america the dominant energy producer in the world  by far    stop outsourcing  and turn the united states into a manufacturing superpower   large tax cuts for workers  and no tax on tips    defend our constitution  our bill of rights  and our fundamentalfreedoms  including freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and theright to keep and bear arms   prevent world war three  restore peace in europe and in the middleeast  and build a great iron dome missile defense shield over ourentire country    all made in america   end the weaponization of government against the american people    stop the migrant crime epidemic  demolish the foreign drug cartels crush gang violence  and lock up violent offenders    rebuild our cities  including washington dc  making them safe  clean and beautiful again 
    strengthen and modernize our military  making it  without question the strongest and most powerful in the world    keep the u 
 dollar as the worlds reserve currency    fight for and protect social security and medicare with no cuts including no changes to the retirement age    cancel the electric vehicle mandate and cut costly and burdensomeregulations    cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory radical gender ideology  and other inappropriate racial  sexual  orpolitical content on our children    keep men out of womens sports    deport pro hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe andpatriotic again    secure our elections  including same day voting  voter identification paper ballots  and proof of citizenship    unite our country by bringing it to new and record levels of success read more about the trump republican platform preamble america first  a return to common sense our nations history is filled with the stories of brave men and women who gave everything they had to build america into the greatest nation in the history of the world 
 generations of american patriots have summoned the american spirit of strength  determination  and love of country to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges 
 the american people have proven time and again that we can overcome any obstacle and any force pitted against us 
 in the early days of our republic  the founding generation defeated what was then the most powerful empire the world had ever seen 
 in the   th century  america vanquished nazism and fascism  and then triumphed over soviet communism after forty four years of the cold war 
 our future  our identity  and our very way of life are under threat like never before 
 today we must once again call upon the same american spirit that led us to prevail through every challenge of the past if we are going to lead our nation to a brighter future 
 for decades  our politicians sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas with unfair trade deals and a blind faith in the siren song of globalism 
 they insulated themselves from criticism and the consequences of their own bad actions  allowing our borders to be overrun  our cities to be overtaken by crime  our system of justice to be weaponized  and our young people to develop a sense of hopelessness and despair 
 quite simply  they did everything in their power to destroy our country 
 trump was elected as an unapologetic champion of the american people 
 he reignited the american spirit and called on us to renew our national pride 
 his policies spurred historic economic growth  job creation  and a resurgence of american manufacturing 
 president trump and the republican party led america out of the pessimism induced by decades of failed leadership  showing us that the american people want greatness for our country again 
 like the heroes who built and defended this nation before us  we will never give up 
 we will restore our nation of  by  and for the people 
 we will be a nation based on truth  justice  and common sense 
 common sense tells us clearly  in president trumps words  that  if we dont have a border  we dont have a country 
  restoring sensible border security and immigration policy requires many steps  all of which would have been and indeed were taken for granted by prior generations as obviously necessary and good 
 we must secure our southern border by completing the border wall that president trump started 
 hundreds of miles have already been built and work magnificently 
 the remaining wall construction can be completed quickly  effectively  and inexpensively 
 we will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals and working with local police 
 under the trump administration and a republican congress  it will be defeated immediately 
 common sense tells us clearly that if we dont have domestic manufacturing with low inflation  not only will our economyand even our military equipment and suppliesbe at the mercy of foreign nations  but our towns  communities  and people cannot thrive 
 the republican party must return to its roots as the party of industry  manufacturing  infrastructure  and workers 
 president trumps economic policy to end inflation and return manufacturing jobs is not only what the american economy and american workers need right now  it is also what they want right now 
 common sense tells us clearly that we must unleash american energy if we want to destroy inflation and rapidly bring down prices  build the greatest economy in history  revive our defense industrial base  fuel emerging industries  and establish the united states as the manufacturing superpower of the world 
 we will drill  baby  drill and we will become energy independent  and even dominant again 
 the united states has more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation  and its not even close 
 the republican party will harness that potential to power our future 
 common sense tells us clearly that if we dont have a strong military  we wont be able to defend our interests and we will be at the mercy of hostile nations 
 the policy of the republican party must be to ensure that americas military is the strongest and best equipped in the worldand that our government uses that great strength sparingly  and only in clear instances where our national interests are threatened 
 common sense tells us clearly that the republican party must stand for equal treatment for all
