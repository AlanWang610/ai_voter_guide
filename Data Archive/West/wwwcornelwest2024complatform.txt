 Black Maternal Justice  
 In the spirit of justice and with a profound commitment to the sanctity of life, the West | Abdullah campaign presents the Black Maternal Justice Pillar. This policy is an acknowledgment of the grave injustices faced by Black mothers in the United States, who endure disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity. It is a moral imperative to confront and dismantle the systemic racism and inequities embedded within our healthcare system that betray Black women during one of the most pivotal experiences of their lives. The Black Maternal Justice Pillar is built upon the following foundational commitments:   Comprehensive Funding Increase: We vow to significantly amplify funding for maternal health initiatives tailored to the needs of Black women. This encompasses bolstering the resources of hospitals and clinics in underserved communities and investing in research that identifies and promotes the most effective strategies for eradicating the maternal mortality crisis among Black women. Cultural Competency and Bias Training: We mandate that all healthcare professionals in obstetrics and gynecology undergo comprehensive cultural competency and implicit bias training. This policy ensures that Black women are met with the respect, understanding, and high-quality care they deserve, free from prejudice and discrimination. Community Health Worker Programs: We champion the expansion of community health worker programs, recognizing their critical role in bridging the gap between Black pregnant women and the healthcare system. These programs will offer vital prenatal and postnatal education, support, and advocacy, ensuring Black women are empowered and supported through their maternity journey. Data Collection and Research: We commit to enhancing data collection on maternal health outcomes for Black women and supporting research into healthcare models that demonstrably improve these outcomes. This initiative is essential for illuminating the depth of disparities and informing targeted, effective interventions. Access to Midwifery and Doula Services: We affirm the right of all Black women to access the care of midwives and doulas, whose presence has been proven to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes significantly. These services, offering culturally competent support, will be made available and covered by all health insurance plans, ensuring that every Black mother can benefit from their invaluable assistance. Policy Oversight Committee: We will establish a national oversight committee dedicated to Black maternal healthcare. This body, comprising healthcare experts, maternal health advocates, and members of the affected communities, will monitor the execution of these policies, evaluate their effectiveness, and recommend additional measures to enhance Black maternal health and well-being. The Black Maternal Justice Pillar declares our campaign's unwavering dedication to rectifying the profound injustices that endanger Black mothers. It affirms our belief in a healthcare system that upholds the dignity, respects the rights, and preserves the lives of all mothers, recognizing the invaluable role they play in the fabric of our society. In advancing these policies, the West | Abdullah campaign seeks to address a critical health crisis and honor every Black woman's inherent worth and her fundamental right to safe, empowering, and dignified maternal care. Join us in this sacred mission to ensure that the promise of justice and equality encompasses the sacred act of bringing life into this world. Child Justice  
 In an unwavering commitment to the sanctity and potential of every child, the Cornel West for President campaign introduces the Child Justice and Protection Pillar. This foundational element of our platform advocates for a world where every child is nurtured in environments that foster their well-being, development, and dignity. It champions a holistic and inclusive approach to child justice and protection, addressing the varied needs of children across the spectrum of society. Here are the key initiatives that comprise this pillar:   Reform Juvenile Justice Systems: Prioritize community-based interventions over detention for youth with lower-level offenses, ensuring the use of confinement is reserved for those who pose significant public safety risks. This initiative seeks to balance the scales of justice, emphasizing rehabilitation and societal reintegration. Uphold Children's Rights in Justice Systems: Guarantee access to child-friendly, gender-sensitive justice systems that respect and protect the rights of all children, particularly those most vulnerable, including minority groups, children with disabilities, and migrant children. Prevention and Diversion Strategies: Develop and implement comprehensive diversion measures and alternatives to detention, firmly establishing the deprivation of liberty as a measure of last resort. This commitment aligns with international standards on child justice, emphasizing the rights and well-being of children in conflict with the law. Strengthen Child Protection Systems: Fortify child protection frameworks to prevent violence against children and support survivors, especially in humanitarian crises. Support governments in crafting policies and legislative frameworks that provide children access to vital social services and justice. Eliminate Harmful Practices and Ensure Safe Environments: Accelerate efforts to eradicate harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) and advocate for safe environments that shield children from exploitation, abuse, and violence, particularly in humanitarian settings. Ensure equal access to quality education by eliminating competitive grants, also known as test-based funding measures, and instead allocating education resources based on need rather than performance. Address the educational disparities between rich and poor school districts for high-quality education access for all. Enact universal access to healthy lunches and provide locally sourced, vegetable-rich food options for all children in K-12 education via the Department of Education.

Affordable and Accessible Housing: Spearheading initiatives for housing that are both affordable and accessible, meeting the diverse needs of individuals with disabilities and fostering independence and community inclusion. Eliminate enforced poverty for people receiving disability support by abolishing net worth limits (which are currently placed at $2,000 total net worth) for folks living with disabilities and receiving compensation due to their inability to access living wage jobs. Allow part-time employment and additional support to that employment so that folks with disabilities can live lives of dignity while participating in their communities.

It is a commitment to building an inclusive, empathetic world where the diversity and potential of every individual with disabilities are recognized, celebrated, and nurtured. Economic Justice

 In the prophetic tradition of justice, the Cornel West for President campaign harkens back to a time when the worth of one's labor was not merely measured in dollars and cents but in dignity, respect, and the collective well-being of our communities.

It acknowledges that our worth is not tied to how many hours we labor but to the quality of our lives and our contributions to society.

By providing free childcare, we not only aid working parents but also invest in our children's future.

It's a vision of a future where economic justice is not a distant dream but a lived reality for every American.
