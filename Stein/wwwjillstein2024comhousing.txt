 Housing    
 There is a housing crisis across the United States. Over 600,000 people were experiencing homelessness in 2023, a record high. Millions more are housing insecure. Rental and housing costs have skyrocketed in recent years. Corporations are buying up land and housing, while developers prioritize luxury housing unaffordable to most people. The Wall Street parties and the developers that fund them have completely failed to meet our housing needs. Housing is a human right. We need to end homelessness, support tenants and homebuyers, and massively invest in public housing to provide high-quality, affordable homes for all. A Jill Stein administration will:   End homelessness and housing insecurity with a Homes Guarantee  Nationally adopt “Housing First” practices  Fund social housing as part of the Real Green New Deal to build at least 15 million green, union-built, publicly-owned homes over the next 10 years  Support a Universal Tenant's Bill of Rights  Direct the Department of Labor to assist with the establishment of a National Tenants Union  Implement universal rent control and a prohibition on excessive rental deposits  Eliminate credit checks from rental applications  Impose taxes on unoccupied homes (vacancy tax) and investment rental “homestay” properties to curb speculation  Expand House Choice Initiatives, and provide full funding to all existing project-based rental assistance contracts  Repeal the Faircloth Amendment so that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) can build public housing again  Prohibit predatory lending, require clearly listed mortgage costs and risks, and no fine print  Expand HUD and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Programs for first-time home buyers, with down-payment assistance, direct guaranteed loans, and pre-purchase housing counseling  Reinvigorate federal housing programs that build publicly-owned housing for families, for the elderly, and for people with disabilities  Expand and protect the homeowner mortgage interest benefit, and eliminate the “second home” and “yacht” loopholes
