 Social Justice    
 Americans cherish ideals of liberty and justice, yet countless millions are still fighting for basic rights. US economic and political systems still have pervasive, systemic discrimination against women, Black and Brown people, Indigenous people, immigrants, people with disabilities, the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, and other marginalized groups. The Wall Street parties, funded by economic elites who seek to divide and conquer the people, pay lip service to ideals of justice while perpetuating the structures of systemic injustice. We need to work towards equity and honor the human rights of every individual. It’s time to come together to ensure true justice for all. Tribal/Indigenous Sovereignty  
 A Jill Stein Administration will guarantee as a human right the sovereignty of the Indigenous people of Turtle Island (today’s U.S.A). We recognize the history of broken treaties, stolen and occupied lands, and the desecration of the indigenous way of life, so our policies aim to redress harm through restorative justice. A Jill Stein Administration will:   Honor all existing treaties with Indigenous nations  Ensure free, prior, and informed consent for any and all activity on tribal sovereign land  Establish a federal Land Back Commission  Create a task force of Tribal nations leaders to assess their needs for infrastructure, resources, education and economic development  Support a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a reparations plan to address Indigenous people’s economic dispossession  Amend the federal regulations to streamline the recognition process of Tribal Nations, Native Hawaiian Nation and other Pacific and Caribbean Islanders  Increase appointments to Tribal liaison positions, boards and commissions to ensure representation on all policies impacting Tribal Nations  Enforce the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People to require tribal consent for granting construction permits on treaty lands, waterways, and usual and accustomed areas  Prohibit all activities on sovereign territories without Free, Prior, and Informed Consent  Defend Tribal rights to regulate and manage their environment’s natural resources  Mandate all property tax revenues from tribal (reservation) lands be shared with the tribes  Remove policies and practices that create barriers in upholding Native voting rights at all levels of government  Protect Native religious freedoms  Declare the second Monday in October as the Federal holiday “Indigenous Peoples Day”  Fund the Indian Health Service and establish at least one IHS clinic in each state  Increase and expand community health centers and behavioral and mental health services for Native youth  Establish an adequately funded medical facility in all reservations  Ensure the Department of Education fully funds and includes Tribal Sovereignty Curriculum developed by Tribal leaders in all states  Provide funding for judicial training on the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to eliminate the loss of Native children’s ties and identities to their families, cultures and homelands  Improve and align government policies and efforts, including data collection, to appropriately identify and classify American Indian/Alaska Native and multi-racial students  Expand funding for Tribal Compact Schools and address the disproportionate rates of drop-out, expulsion and suspension rates of Native students at the K-12 level  Expand access to Tribal Colleges and Universities, Native Studies programs in mainstream Colleges and Universities  Officially recognize children lost to adoption under the Indian Relocation Act of 1952, tribal members who were dis-enrolled during the U.S. Indian Tribes termination policies (1940 to mid-1960), prior to the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 and reunify them with their tribes and families  Ensure the rights of Tribal Nations to investigate and exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Native citizens who commit domestic or sexual violence on Tribal lands in accordance with the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)  Maintain and authorize the VAWA to fund and expand the specific Tribal Nations’ provisions, such as judicial training  Improve and fund Native lands’ justice systems to facilitate prosecution of non-natives accused of serious crimes  Ensure correct Native classification of Missing and Murdered Native women in the federal records  Increase tribal, federal, state and local cooperation to end the crisis of Missing and Murdered Native women  Commission a report on the pipeline culture as an intrinsic factor in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis of and mandate oil companies fund resources for crisis prevention  Improve state-federal-tribal relations to avoid bias and discriminatory policing through law enforcement cross-cultural education with Tribal Nations  Expand funding of Urban Indian health organizations to enable them to address the health needs of Native Americans in urban areas who may not have access to Tribal health facilities  Fund Indian Health Service’s (IHS) trust responsibility for Urban Indians so IHS funds can never be taken from the Federally Recognized Tribal allotment to fund Urban Indian Healthcare  Address the disproportionately high rates of homelessness among Urban Indians  Halt gentrification in Tribal and poor communities that prices people out of their communities  Help States develop and fund Urban Indian Liaison Offices to improve community relations   
 Reparations and the Agenda to Facilitate Black Liberation  
 A Jill Stein Administration will guarantee as a human right reparations to the descendants of African slaves for the historic crime of enslavement. Reparations is a cornerstone of the Black Agenda, but reparations is far from the only policy needed to begin to redress what has been stolen from the Black community over 400+ years. Scholars and activists who have studied and formulated propositions for Reparations itself have put the minimum cash value of reparations at $12 trillion, to be paid to those who claim legitimate descendancy from enslaved Blacks prior to the Civil War. This number is derived not only from the stolen labor prior to 1865, but also from the reneged promise of Field Order 15, commonly referred to as “40 acres and a mule”, which was never made good upon. We don’t need any further debate on whether reparations should be paid. They should, without question, as they were in 1988 to those impacted by WWII Japanese internment camps. The Stein administration will confer with Black community leaders on who qualifies, how they qualify (historical records exist), how much they will be paid in cash, and how those payments will be made. There are other policies essential to the overall Black Agenda, as slavery was not the only historic crime against the Black community in America. We recognize both historic and existing racism in America, While it has been addressed in legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to this day an end to systemic racism has never been realized. Many of these essential policies, such as universal healthcare, immigration, policing,  and free public college education, are addressed in other areas of this platform. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Black Agenda is a progressive agenda. In addition to ensuring Reparations, a Jill Stein Administration will:   Direct all federal agencies to consider and include race and ethnicity as part of all of their initiatives and other programs implemented with federal dollars  Overturn the harmful Alexander v. Sandoval Supreme Court decision that currently increases the burden for, or eliminates private right of action against entities that violate Title VI and other mandates contained in the Civil RIghts Act of 1964  Promulgate a moratorium on all proposed Cop Cities and end federal investments in such facilities  Establish a National Office for Civilian Oversight Committees to ensure greater transparency and accountability for civilian law enforcement departments  Establish a multi-agency federal Returning Citizens Task Force to assist and provide resources for the formerly incarcerated in an effort to expedite their journey back to full citizen status including, but not limited to, immediate restoration of voting rights in most cases  Increase investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and leverage the power of the federal government to force states to compensate state run, land grant HBCUs the more than $13 Billion they are owed  Increase investments in programs that support Black-owned businesses. Ensure that a universal single-payer healthcare system addresses and resolves the health outcome disparities for the Black community, and in particular for Black women  Eliminate ‘food deserts’ where fresh produce and food sovereignty is largely unavailable, a condition which disproportionately impacts Black communities. Work with Congress and federal agencies to codify the Justice for Black Farmers Act  Eliminate white nationalists from police forces by Federal law, and ensure white nationalist groups’ activities are routinely monitored, due to white nationalist violence being the greatest single source of domestic terrorism. Ensure the Office of Civil Rights is fully funded, staffed, and fulfills its obligation to protect the civil rights of marginalized communities. Restore Section 4(b) and Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and permanently certify the entire law  Address and ameliorate the legacy of redlining through programs that deliver recompense for Black homeowners whose home values are adversely and disproportionately impacted to this day by this systemically racist practice  Federal moratorium on new construction of fossil fuel infrastructure and other polluting operations in or proximate to Black and other environmental justice communities  Massive reinvestment from policing and prisons into social, economic, and other programs that lead to direct community benefits  Establish a federal commission to eradicate the lead pipes and tainted water crisis impacting cities like Flint, MI within one year after I take office  Work with Congress and impacted community members to draft and pass the Justice for Cancer Alley Act that will include compensation and free healthcare in perpetuity for victims in this region who have been subjected to environmentally racist practices for decades  Coordinate with Black-led formations including, but not limited to, the Black Hive at Movement for Black Lives to codify proposals and demands included in their Black Climate Mandate   Coordinate with Black-led formations including, but not limited to, the Black Alliance for Peace to promulgate their Zone of Peace strategies that combat and dismantle larger structures and interests that generate war and state violence—colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism and all forms of imperialism both domestically and internationally

 2SLGBTQIA+ Rights  
 A Jill Stein Administration will guarantee the human rights of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. Violent attacks on transgender women (particularly Black and other transgender women of color), recent stripping of state protections, lack of legal protection after negative court rulings, and long-standing historical inequities continue.

 Disability Rights  
 A Jill Stein Administration will guarantee as a human right that every person with visible or invisible disabilities is free from ableist policies that harm and isolate them. We commit to ending disparities in pay, benefits, housing, healthcare, and education, and commit to disability inclusion and representation to ensure that all people can contribute their talents and skills as full members of a diverse and thriving society. Here’s how:   Work towards economic security for people with disabilities by ensuring opportunities to partake fully in the economy at a fair wage and to enable financial security for all  Make sure that technology is accessible and supports the goals of the diverse lives of people with disabilities  Help children with disabilities and their families by providing life-changing early interventions and getting them valuable access to education  Defend the civil liberties of people with disabilities in areas like criminal justice, voting, physical and mental health, parental rights, and marriage equality  End all exceptions in wage laws and workplace protections for individuals with disabilities  Expand Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Social Income (SSI) to a living wage of greater than 10% of regional Cost of Living calculations  Expand access to Social Security/SSDI/SSI, including assistance of public lawyers in SSDI application.

 Women's Rights  
 Women’s rights are human rights. As women's freedoms, protections and rights are continually under assault by extremist groups, we will defend and codify women’s full rights once and for all. A Jill Stein administration will:   Publish the Equal Rights Amendment  Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (HR 7) to end pay discrimination and ensure equal pay for equal work  Pass the 2021 Violence Against Women Act  Ensure that domestic abusers cannot own or buy a gun  Federally fund and expedite all rape kit testing  Codify Roe v Wade  Ensure full reproductive rights and bodily autonomy for women  Repeal the Hyde Amendment  Fund free birth control and menstruation products  Repeal FOSTA/SESTA which puts sex workers at risk  Decriminalize sex work  Expand the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)  Protect and enforce Title IX  Ensure prosecution of sexual harassment and violence in the workplace and the military
