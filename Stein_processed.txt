 our defense budget has increased out of all proportion to any military threat to the united states  and to our domestic social  economic and environmental needs 
 the united states government must reduce our defense budget to half of its current size 
 the      defense budget exceeded      billion  and that does not take into account military expenditures not placed under the defense budget 
 our nation was born as the first great experiment in modern democracy 
 we seek to rescue that heritage from the erosion of citizen participation 
 moreover  we seek to dissolve the grip of the ideology  intoned by big money interests for more than twenty years  that government is intrinsically undesirable and destructive of liberty and that elected officials should rightly  starve the beast  by slashing all spending on social program  in the name of freedom 
 we challenge that tactic by calling on all americans to think deeply about the meaning of government of the people  by the people  and for the people 
 in a democracy  individuals come together to form structures of governance that protect and advance the common good 
 we the citizens are the government  and we the citizens can direct it to fulfill its finest goals and purposes 
 our citizens must not permit usurpation of their authority by acts of individuals and government agencies that isolate or insulate government from their oversight and control 
 we  the people  have a responsibility to participate in self government through all the means that our constitution provides 
 citizens of a democracy must have the information and ability to determine the actions of their government 
 vast concentrations of wealth and power that have occurred in recent years are inherently undemocratic 
 the deregulation of corporate activity and the decentralization and underfunding of the regulatory structures that remainaccompanied by the centralizing of big money has been a disaster for our country 
 the true owners of the public lands  pension funds  and the public airwaves are the american people  who today have little or no control over their pooled assets or their commonwealth 
 the power of civic action is an antidote to the corporate control of so much of our lawmaking and regulating 
 the pervasive abuse imposed by corporate power increasingly undermines our democracy  but the green party seeks to rekindle the democratic flame 
 as voting citizens  taxpayers  workers  consumers  and stakeholders  we unite to exercise our rights and  as thomas jefferson urged  to counteract the  excesses of the moneyed interests 
  toward this end  we consider serious reform of campaign funding to be essential  as well as curbs on the influence of corporations on lawmakers and regulatory agencies 
 the green party considers american democracy to be an ongoing  unfolding project that is dynamic and creative in nature 
 we are committed to the strengthening of our civil society  including the many mediating institutions at the community level that have always characterized our democracy 
 we seek to heal the alienation and apathy that has been cultivated in the citizenry by the power brokers of the status quo 
 righteous anger about the crippling of our democracy is rising in the land  and the greens offer constructive alternatives 
 in addition  we seek to repair the plummeting opinion of the united states in the international community resulting from our arrogant  narcissistic foreign policy of recent years 
 a growing and grave imbalance between the citizens of this country and the interests that extract power from the citizens is an imminent danger to our security and national and global social stability 
 we strongly feel that our country should view itself as a member of the community of nations 
 the united states could well play a leadership role in that community but only if we become committed to an eco social vision of peace  national self determination  and international cooperation 
 our goal is to become an important political force in this country  and to present candidates for election at every level of government 
 political reform our position greens will crack down on political corruption and strengthen the voice of the people at all levels of government 
 everyone deserves the opportunity to influence the governmental decisions that affect them 
 but the defining characteristics of modern politics in the united states are a corrupt campaign finance system that enables corporate and wealthy elites to purchase political outcomes  and an abundance of anti democratic electoral  ballot access and debate rules designed to minimize participation and choice 
 to achieve genuine citizen participation  citizens must share in the power of governing 
 greens seek to bring vibrant grassroots democracy to every part of the united states 
 electoral system  from how elections are financed  to conducting them in more fair and representative ways  to ensuring accountability and transparency on all levels of government 
 winner take all voting system is fundamentally flawed  resulting in low voter participation  little choice or competition in countless elections  and far too few women and minorities in elected office 
 the failure to fulfill the promise of democracy leaves millions of people in our country too discouraged to vote and others who chose to vote seemingly trapped among false and limited choices 
 a system that promotes full and fair representation would draw millions of people in the united states into civic life and could revive democracy in this country 
 enact proportional representation voting systems for legislative seats on municipal  county  state and federal levels 
 proportional representation systems provide that voters are represented in the proportion their views are held in society  and are based on dividing seats proportionally within multi seat districts  compared to the standard u 
 forms of proportional representation include ranked choice voting  rcv   candidate based   party list  party based  and mixed member proportional  mmp  voting  combines proportional representation with district representation  
 enact ranked choice voting for chief executive offices such as mayor  governor  and president and other single seat offices including u 
 senate  while retaining the right for all ballot qualified parties to place their partys nominee on the general election ballot in partisan elections 
 under ranked choice voting  voters can rank candidates in order of preference         etc 
 ranked choice voting ensures that the eventual winner has majority support and eliminates vote splitting  allowing voters to express their preferences knowing that supporting their favorite candidate will not inadvertently help their least favored candidate 
 ranked choice voting frees voters from being pressured to choose between the lesser of two evils  allows them to vote their hopes  not their fears  and saves public funds by eliminating unnecessary run off elections 
  oppose top x  top two four five  primary elections for state and federal office  regardless of whether they utilize ranked choice voting for the general election 
 top x elections are anti democracy  anti party  and misdirect voter frustration into counter productive reform 
 instead of promoting proportional representation  top x systems restrict representation to only one representative per legislative district 
 instead of promoting voter choice  top x systems eliminate a guaranteed place on the general election ballot for candidates from all ballot qualified parties  and take away these parties right to nominate their own candidates 
 top x primaries are not suitable to handle large numbers of competitive major party candidates  with competition among candidates of the same major parties that dont actually represent significantly different policies crowding out minor parties with distinct perspectives 
 misleadingly  proponents of top x primaries call them open primaries 
 open primaries are systems that retain party primaries  but allow any voter to choose to vote in a party primary of their choice 
 instead of promoting an inclusive multi party system  top x systems eliminate party primaries 
 substantially expand the number of seats in the u 
 house of representatives together with electing the house from multi seat districts by proportional representation both by federal legislation to help make the house far more representative of the nations population and rich diversity 
 towards this end  amend or repeal the the permanent apportionment act of        https   history 
gov historical highlights           the permanent apportionment act of          which limits the size of the house  and amend or repeal and replace the      law  pl          http   archive

 as a step in that direction  support national popular vote legislation which would guarantee the presidency to the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes in all    states  and the district of columbia   which would take effect only when enacted  in identical form  by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes   that is  enough electoral votes to elect a president      of      
 create a new publicly funded peoples commission on presidential debates  and open its presidential and vice presidential debates to all candidates who appear on at least as many ballots as would represent a majority of the electoral college and who raise enough funds to otherwise qualify for general election public financing 
 any candidate who refuses to participate in such debates would lose general election public financing for their candidacy 
 amend federal law to remove the non profit tax exemption status that allows corporations to fund the existing commission on presidential debates and other such exclusive privately controlled debate entities 
 reinstate public funding of presidential conventions  and establish the percentage of the presidential popular vote required for a new party to receive public presidential convention funding at    for its candidate in the previous general election include the option to vote for a binding none of the above  nota  on all party primary and general election ballots

 clarify that section   provides for a board understanding of disproportionate negative impact upon protected classes

 make it easier to meet the goals of the federal voting rights acts  by expanding the number of seats in the u 
 house of representatives in combination with elections from multi seat districts by proportional representation  because more seats and more proportionally awarded seats means fewer conflicts among multiple traditionally under represented groups competing for too few winner take all seats 
 establish  through state legislation  the preregistration of sixteen  and seventeen year olds and provide educational opportunities for them to practice voting as part of the preregistration process 
 restore full citizenship rights to felons upon completion of their sentence  including the right to run for elected office

 campaign finance reform provide full public financing of federal  state and local elections  including free candidate statements in official government voter guides  and free and equal radio and television time on the public airwaves for all ballot qualified candidates and parties 
 amend the federal election campaign act to change the percentage of the presidential popular vote required for a new partys candidate to receive first time general election public funding from    in the previous general election to     amend the u 
 constitution to unequivocally define that money is not a form of free speech  that human beings  not corporations  are persons entitled to constitutional rights  and that full regulation or limitation of campaign contributions and spending be allowed by law 
 such an amendment would overturn citizens united v 
 amend the constitution to authorize the regulation of election contributions and spending to eliminate undue influence of money in our political system  and to protect the rights of all americans to free speech  political participation  and meaningful representation in government 
 together these reforms would address campaign finance transparency of dark money while ending independent campaign expenditures by the corporate rich

 community community is the basic unit of green politics because it is personal  value oriented  and small enough for each member to have an impact 
 community involvement is a foundation for public policy 
 social diversity is the wellspring of community life where old and young  rich and poor  and people of all races and beliefs can interact individually and learn to care for each other  and to understand and cooperate 
 we emphasize a return to local  face to face relationships that humans can understand and care about 
 among greens  our guiding principle is to think globally and act locally 
 community needs recognize a diversity of issues  and local control recognizes a variety of approaches to solving problems  ones that tend to be bottom up not top down 
 green politics does not place its faith in paternalistic big government 
 instead  greens believe face to face interactions are essential to productive and meaningful lives for all citizens 
 the green vision includes building communities that nurture families  generate good jobs and housing  and provide public services  creating cities and towns that educate children  encourage recreation  and preserve natural and cultural resources  building local governments that protect people from environmental hazards and crime  and motivating citizens to participate in making decisions 
 the green vision calls for a global community of communities that recognize our immense diversity  respect our personal worth  and share a global perspective 
 we call for an approach to politics that acknowledges our endangered planet and habitat 
 our politics responds to global crises with a new way of seeing our shared international security 
 we will conceive a new era of international cooperation and communication that nurtures cultural diversity  recognizes the interconnectedness between communities  and promotes opportunities for cultural exchange and assistance 
 we call for increased public transportation  convenient playgrounds and parks for all sections of cities and small towns  and funding to encourage diverse neighborhoods 
transportation in chapter iii  we support a rich milieu of art  culture  and significant  yet modestly funded  programs such as the national endowment for the arts and national endowment for the humanities 
 families and children we call for social policies to focus on protecting families 
 the young our citizens of tomorrow are increasingly at risk 
 programs must ensure that children  who are among the most vulnerable members of society  receive basic nutritional  educational  and medical necessities 
 the green party supports and seeks to expand head start and pre  and neo natal programs 
 a childrens agenda should be put in place to focus attention and concerted action on the future that is our children 
 youth rights in chapter ii  a universal  federally funded childcare program for pre school and young schoolchildren should be developed 
 family assistance such as the earned income tax credit  available to working poor families in which the parent supports and lives with the children  should be maintained and increased to offset regressive payroll taxes and growing inequalities in american society 
 true cost pricing and tax fairness in chapter iv  a living family wage is vital to the social health of communities 
 livable income in chapter iv  the actuarial protection of social security is essential to the well being of our seniors  and maintenance of the systems integrity is an essential part of a healthy community 
 we oppose privatization of social security  call for the program to remain under the aegis of the federal government  and seek to expand its effectiveness 
 national debt in chapter iv   we support the leading edge work of non profit public interest groups and those individuals breaking out of  careerism  to pursue non traditional careers in public service 
 alternative community service we must create new opportunities for citizens to serve their communities through non military community service 
 alternative community service to the military should be encouraged 
 we advocate the formation of a civilian conservation corps  with national leadership and state and local affiliates  to spearhead efforts to work on the tasks of environmental education  restoration of damaged habitats  reforestation  and cleaning up polluted waterways 
 providing land and resource management skills will challenge young people while encouraging social responsibility 
 free speech and media reform our position independent  critical media are essential to an informed and healthy democracy 
 citizens must have ready access to news and information to make responsible informed choices as voters and to carry out their other duties of citizenship 
 the united states original communications policy was the  st amendment 
 freedom of the press was guaranteed in the constitution because an exchange of ideas and an unfettered debate were considered essential components of a democratic society 
 today  however  government policy is designed less to enhance public deliberation than to boost the profitability of media corporations 
 our media laws and rules promote the formation of huge media conglomerates while discouraging competing voices 
 as a result  the mainstream media is increasingly cozy with the economic and political elites whom they should be investigating 
 mergers in the news industry have accelerated  further limiting the spectrum of viewpoints in the mass media 
 media overwhelmingly owned by for profit conglomerates and supported by corporate advertisers  investigative journalism is in an alarming decline 
 in response  greens will strengthen citizens influence over the broadcast media  break up the dominant media conglomerates and boost the number of community and non profit news outlets  all to fortify the medias crucial watchdog function and to help create a more diverse and lively exchange of ideas in america 
 since governments too often have an interest in controlling the flow of information  we must constantly guard against official censorship 
 in our society however  large corporations are a far more common source of censorship than governments 
 media outlets kill stories because they undermine corporate interests  advertisers use their financial clout to squelch negative reports  powerful businesses employ the threat of expensive lawsuits to discourage legitimate investigations 
 the most frequent form of censorship is self censorship  journalists deciding not to pursue certain stories that they know will be unpopular with the advertisers 
 green solutions return ownership and control of the electromagnetic spectrum to the public 
 the privatization of the broadcast airwaves  one of our most important taxpayer assets  has caused serious deformations of our politics and culture 
 end the privatization of broadcast frequencies and reserve them for the creation of new not for profit community broadcasters around the country and for broadband and wifi networks owned and operated by cities  counties and towns which want to deliver this vital tool to their people at reasonable cost 
 enact tough new anti trust laws for the media  carve up the big media conglomerates  and follow up with vigorous anti trust enforcement 
 end commercial broadcasters free licensed use of the public airwaves 
 require market priced leasing of any commercial use of the electromagnetic spectrum 
 revenues derived from these license fees should be used to fund the operation of community media 
 tax electronic advertising to fund democratic media outlets 
 reinstate and strengthen the fairness doctrine  to require that holders of broadcast licenses present controversial issues of public importance in an equitable and balanced manner 
 establish substantial public interest obligations for broadcasters and hold them accountable  and revoke licenses from outlets that fail to satisfy these obligations 
 support public  educational and governmental  peg  access television to ensure that citizens and community organizations have the opportunity to create and present their own programming on cable television 
 expand the role of community radio  by expanding the licensing of new non commercial low power fm radio stations 
 promote greater opportunity for women and minority ownership of media outlets 
 greens welcome the continuing and evolving potential of the internet to build communities  educate  inform  and promote free speech and artistic expression 
 provide broadband internet access for all residents of this country  so that access to information is a right  not a commodity 
 we call for the federal communications commission to consistently classify all internet service providers  regardless of the type of service  cable  dial up  satellite  etc 
 we call for the specific classification of all internet service providers as common carriers as used in title ii of the communications act 
 we support all efforts to achieve net neutrality 
 internet users should be able to access any lawful web content they choose and use any applications they choose  without restrictions or limitations imposed by their internet service provider or government  except for restrictions that exist to prevent spam e mail  viruses  and similar content that will harm the providers network or internet access devices 
 ensure free and equal airtime for all ballot qualified political candidates and parties on radio and television networks and stations 
 provide public funding for independent nonprofit broadcasters to ensure high quality news and cultural programming with the widest possible range of viewpoints 
 prohibit commercial advertising targeted to children less than    years old  as well as advertising in public places such as schools  parks  and government buildings 
 oppose censorship in the arts  media  press and on the internet 
 reform the federal communications commission so that it is responsive and accountable to the public at large  not just to lobbyists and commercial interests 
 reduce mailing costs for non profit and independent magazines and journals  and eliminate them for those that receive less than     of their revenues from advertising 
 promote policies to expand investigative reporting on federal  state and local issues 
 promote policies to encourage the people of the united states to watch less television  and instead to spend time with their families  friends and neighbors  and to engage in myriad other constructive  artistic or healthful pursuits 
 create a publicly controlled  audience network  empowered to take airtime from commercial television and radio stations  to broadcast a variety of non commercial cultural  political  entertainment  scientific or other high quality programs

 in the area of trade  third  and fourth world economies and resources are being ravaged and our own economy and job security undermined by global corporatization  which concentrates greater power in the hands of fewer interests who are unaccountable to the vast majority of the worlds people

 we face a more complex set of challenges in how our nation defines its national security

 our government does not have any moral or legal right  or any justification  to preemptively attack another nation 
 the only legitimate use of military force is to repel an actual attack on our nation 
 we demand that our government adhere to international law  including the kellogg briand pact  nuremberg charter and united nations charter  which prohibit any and all preemptive wars or first strikes with any and all weaponry  nuclear and non nuclear 
 we demand repeal not amendment    of the authorization for use of military force  aumf  passed by congress in response to the attacks of september           and oppose any other measure purporting to authorize preemptive or illegal military action 
 in passing the aumf  congress abdicated its exclusive authority under the constitution to declare war 
 it further violated the constitution and betrayed its responsibility to the american people by delegating to the president one person virtually dictatorial power to commit acts of war whenever he or she chooses

 numerous studies have shown that the war on terror has created an ever increasing number of terrorists  destabilized the middle east and beyond  and created massive death and destruction 
 it serves to maintain the us in a state of perpetual war 
 our government should establish a policy to abolish nuclear weapons 
 it should set the conditions and schedule for fulfilling that goal by taking the following steps  declare a no first strike policy 
 will never threaten or use a nuclear weapon  regardless of size  on a non nuclear nation 
 our pledge to end testing will open the way for non nuclear states to sign the non proliferation treaty  npt   which has been held up by our refusal to sign the ctbt 
 honor the conditions set in the npt for nuclear nations 
 reverse our withdrawal from the anti ballistic missile treaty and honor its stipulations 
 end the research  testing and stockpiling of all nuclear weapons of any size 
 dismantle all nuclear warheads from their missiles 
 we urge our government to sign the toronto treaty banning the production  stockpiling  use and sale of land mines  and assist other nations in unearthing and disabling land mines buried in their lands 
 we urge our government to end all stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons and all research  use  and sale of such weapons  and sign the convention that will establish the decrease and inspection of all nations stockpiles of such weapons  which the u 
 our defense budget has increased out of all proportion to any military threat to the united states  and to our domestic social  economic and environmental needs 
 the united states government must reduce our defense budget to half of its current size 
 the      defense budget exceeded      billion  and that does not take into account military expenditures not placed under the defense budget 
 we urge our government to phase out all bases not specifically functioning under a u 
 resolution to keep peace and bring home our troops stationed abroad  except for the military assigned to protect a u 
 many of these bases are small and can be closed immediately 
 foreign military bases at a rate of closure of     to     of their numbers every year 
 close the western hemisphere institute for security cooperation  formerly known as the school of the americas  in ft 
 is the largest arms seller and dealer in the world 
 we urge our government to prohibit all arms sales to foreign nations and likewise prohibit grants to impoverished and undemocratic nations unless the money is targeted on domestic  non military needs 
 in addition  grants to other nations may not be used to release their own funds for military purposes 
 must not be a conduit for defense contractors to market their products abroad and must shift our export market from arms to peaceful technology  industrial and agricultural products  and education 
 must prohibit all covert actions used to influence  de stabilize or usurp the governments of other nations  and likewise prohibit the assassination of  or assistance in any form for the assassination of  foreign government officials 
 we must build on the earth charter that came out of the      u

 a real road to peace in the middle east the green party of the united states recognizes that our greatest contribution to peace in the middle east will come through our impact on u 
 our commitments to ecological wisdom  social justice  grass roots democracy  and non violence compel us to oppose u 
 government support for  friendly  regimes in the region when those regimes violate human rights  international law  and existing treaties 
 we call on congressional intelligence committees to conduct comprehensive public hearings on the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction by all states in the region

 iran the green party supports the  joint comprehensive plan of action  signed in july       by iran and the p     five permanent members of the un security council  china  france  russia  united kingdom  united states plus germany   and the european union  which confirms irans status as a zone free of nuclear weapons 
 according to the united states national intelligence estimate  iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in the fall of      
 iran  which has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty  has consistently called for a nuclear free zone in the entire middle east 
 the  joint comprehensive plan of action  provides that in return for iran upholding its agreements to rid itself of nuclear material as verified by inspections by the international atomic energy agency  iaea   current economic sanctions by the us  european union and un security council will be lifted 
 the green party supports the swift elimination of these economic sanctions on iran and looks to the normalization of relations between iran and the united states 
 in keeping with un resolutions call for a nuclear free middle east  the green party also calls on israel  the only nuclear power in the middle east with at least     nuclear warheads  to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and sign on to the nuclear non proliferation treaty 
 the palestinian israeli conflict our green values oblige us to stand against oppression  against settler colonialism and against the international crime of apartheid 
 we recognize that jewish insecurity and fear of non jews is understandable in light of the history of horrific oppression and extermination of jews in europe 
 however  we oppose as both discriminatory and ultimately self defeating the position that jews would be fundamentally threatened by the implementation of full rights for palestinians 
 we also reject the zionist concept of an exclusive jewish homeland at the expence of the indigenous palestinian population 
 greens  we refuse to impose our views on the people of the region 
 government towards a new policy  one that recognizes the equality  the inherent humanity  and the equal civil and human rights of jews  muslims  christians  and all who live in the region 
 we recognize that the prevailing palestinian view is that the two state solution is neither democratic nor viable in the face of international law  material conditions and  facts on the ground  that now exist in historic palestine 
 we recognize that a growing number of palestinians now supports a one state solution which guarantees equal rights for all its citizens 
 greens recognize and reaffirm the right of self determination for both palestinians and israelis  and their right to live in a single undivided secular and democratic state where all residents have full and equal rights  and freedoms 
 we reaffirm the right and feasibility of palestinian refugees to return to their homes in israel 
 we acknowledge the significant challenges of equity and restitution this policy would encounter and call on the u 
 government to make resolution of these challenges a central goal of our diplomacy in the region 
 we reject the grossly unbalanced financial and military support of israel by the u 
 while israel occupies palestinian lands  maintains and grows settler colonialism  expands an illegal apartheid system  and perpetuates violent military governance against non jews throughout the region 
 president and congress to suspend all military and foreign aid  including loans and grants  to israel until israel withdraws from the occupied territories  dismantles the separation wall in the occupied west bank including east jerusalem  ends its siege of gaza and dismantles settler colonies and systemic apartheid toward its non jewish citizens 
 political support for israel and demand that the u 
 government end its veto of security council resolutions pertaining to israel 
 to secure israels complete withdrawal to  at least  the      boundaries and comply fully with international law 
 position with respect to all united nations  arab league and palestinian led initiatives  the office the high commission on human rights  ohchr  and un special rapporteur advisories that seek a just end to israeli settler colonialism and apartheid safeguarding human rights defenders and the human rights of all palestinians 
 we call on the foreign and military affairs committees of the u 
 house and senate to conduct full hearings on the status of human rights and war crimes by israel as well as right of return for palestinian refugees 
 despite decades of continuous diplomatic attempts by the international community  all efforts to bring about israels compliance with international law or respect for basic palestinian human rights have failed 
 despite abundant condemnation of israels policies by the un  international court of justice  all relevant international conventions  and human rights organizations  israeli violations  crimes of apartheid and ethnic cleansing against palestinians continue with impunity 
 we recall that ending institutionalized racism  apartheid  in south africa demanded an unusual  cooperative action by the entire international community in the form of a boycott  divestment  and sanctions  bds  campaign 
 bds can become an effective nonviolent means for achieving justice and genuine peace between palestinians and israelis  and for the region  through concerted international pressure similar to that which was applied to apartheid south africa 
 palestinian resistance to ongoing dispossession has mainly been nonviolent  including its most basic formremaining in their homes  on their land  and while palestinian armed resistance is legitimate under international law when directed at non civilian targets  we believe that only nonviolent resistance will maintain the humanity of palestinian society  elicit the greatest solidarity from others  and maximize the chance for future reconciliation between israelis and palestinians 
 however  we also recognize that our appeal to palestinians to continue to resist nonviolently in the face of ongoing existential threats from israel is hypocritical unless accompanied by substantial acts of international support 
 we recall that in       palestinian civil society appealed to the international community to support a bds campaign against israel  and that in response the green party of the us endorsed this bds campaign in      
 therefore  we support the implementation of boycott and divestment initiatives against israel similar to those applied to south africa in the apartheid era  which includes pressuring our government to impose targeted embargoes and sanctions against israel 
 we support maintaining these nonviolent punitive measures until israel meets its obligation to recognize the palestinian peoples inalienable right to self determination and fully complies with the precepts of international law by  ending its occupation and colonization of all palestinian lands and dismantling the wall in the west bank recognizing the fundamental rights of palestinian citizens of israel and palestinians to full equality  and respecting  protecting and promoting the rights of palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in un resolution     
 in addition  we are committed to building solidarity among the u 
 population for the global bds movement as well as with palestinian  israeli and international human rights organizations which fight against israeli apartheid 
 we recognize the structures and systems put in place for a just and peaceful future are for the people to decide without the scale tipping towards the colonizers who hold drastically greater power 
 should the united nations and international civil society conduct palestinian led peace negotiations  we recognize the usefulness of a truth and reconciliation commission whose inaugurating action could be mutual acknowledgement by israelis and palestinians that they have the same basic inherent rights  including the right to exist and flourish in the same  safe and secure place of a homeland 
 foreign policytrade we urge our government to do the following  re formulate all international trade relations and commerce as currently upheld by the north american free trade agreement  nafta   the world trade organization  wto   the international monetary fund  imf  and world bank  wb  to protect the labor  human rights  economy  environment and domestic industry of partner and recipient nations so that the growth of local industry and agriculture has the advantage over foreign corporate domination 
 government should call for replacing the wto  imf  and world bank with new institutions that are democratic  transparent  and accountable to the citizens of all nations 
 while the imf and world bank still exist in their current forms  re structure the rules of performance of the imf wb to end the debts of recipient nations  prohibit the use of imf wb loans to impose structural adjustment programs that emphasize debt service and export led development at the expense of social needs  and to install strict standards in the imf wb that control the use of grants or loans to prevent fraud  misuse  and subversion of funds by recipient governments 
 re write the rules for investment of corporate capital in projects operated under the imf wb to guarantee the rights of the citizens of the nations receiving the investment and their right to public ownership and control of their own resources 
 mandate and protect labors right to organize  create unions and negotiate with management in all countries receiving u 
 corporations that operate in other countries to adhere to the core labor standards established by the international labor organization  ilo  declaration of the fundamental principles and rights at work 
 legislate and enable oversight by an independent agency or a labor union to verify that foreign workers rights are protected 
 at home  secure the rights of our states to establish stricter standards for health  safety  and for the environment than those of our national government  and to protect themselves against substandard  imported goods 
 secure the right of states and municipalities to refuse to invest in foreign businesses that do not abide by their standards for imported goods  fair trade  and environmental protection 
 corporations from avoiding or evading payment of their taxes by banking abroad or locating their charters offshore 
 every day over    trillion dollars circles the globe in currency tradewreaking havoc on low economy nations without obligation to sustainable investment 
 we seek to restrict the unfettered flow of capital and currency trade  and levy the tobin tax of  
 fair taxation in chapter iv  we support the funding and expansion of non governmental organizations  ngos  in their missions to educate and train people of less developed nations in initiating local business and economic development  and in providing health care and family planning 
 under the agency of the united nations  we demand that our government renew and initiate government funding and support for family planning  contraception  and abortion in all countries that request it 
 congress to lift the embargo and restore normal diplomatic relations and respect for national sovereignty  and demand that the u 
 human rights we propose the following amendment to the constitution of the united states  the rights established by this constitution and the laws of the united states of america are exclusively the rights of living  breathing humans  citizens of this country or residing therein 
 no corporation or other type of association or organization can have the status of a  legal person  and thus cannot derive rights from such status 
 these organizations have no permanent  constitutionally protected rights  though they may have such powers or immunities as are explicitly granted to them by legislative actions at either the federal or the state level 
 these powers or immunities may be modified or removed by later action of the same legislative bodies 
 in no case can these powers or immunities override the constitutionally protected rights of human beings 
 womens rights the green party makes a strong and urgent call for u 
 passage of cedaw  the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women  which was adopted in      by the un general assembly and ratified by     countries 
 it is also known as the womens convention  the womens bill of rights  and an international bill of rights for women 
 the united states is one of a very few countries and the only industrialized nation that has not ratified it 
 the illegal international trafficking in humans  primarily women  has reached staggering numbers and consequences around the world 
 the green party supports the un protocol to prevent  suppress and punish trafficking in persons  especially women and children  which supplements the un convention against transnational organized crime adopted by the un general assembly in november      as an important tool to facilitate international cooperation 
 and    other countries signed the protocol in december      and by doing so have made a commitment to criminalize trafficking and to protect its many victims 
 we call for effective collaborative relationships between sending and receiving countries  including the u 
 we also call for studies analyzing and connecting the role of globalization in trafficking 
 puerto rican independence in       puerto rico was invaded by the united states and has been held by the u 
 in response to international pressure  in       the u 
 established the  free associated state  status for puerto rico but continued to claim that puerto rico belongs to  yet is not a part of  the united states 
 the root of the crisis is the colonial status of puerto rico as echoed in the un decolonization committee resolution on puerto rico adopted on june          which states the condition of political subordination prevents puerto rico from taking sovereign decisions to attend to its serious economic and social problems including unemployment  marginalization and poverty  olga sanabria davila  crisis and colonialism in puerto rico            
 greens support the right of the people of puerto rico to self determination and independence in conformity with united nations resolution      xv  of      
 greens call for the release of all puerto rican political prisoners  such as oscar lopez rivera  who has been held in u 
 greens call for the appropriate environmental clean up and sustainable development of vieques  the island that was used as a firing range by the u 
 greens oppose recruitment of the youth of puerto rico into the u 
 wars abroad  and denounce recruitment attempts at educational institutions 
 further  greens recognize that    puerto ricos debt is unpayable 
   that in the last    years alone  foreign corporations operating in puerto rico have reaped over     billion dollars in tax free profits     per cent of which would suffice to pay its current otherwise unpayable debt 
   austerity measures like a  financial control authority   which have proven to exacerbate economic suffering and strip away democratic rights to self determination  must be opposed 
   the social cost of increasing the sales tax  of reducing workers pay  education and health services  of eliminating labor rights gained and the dismantling of the retirement system among other recessionary measures  are a detriment to the quality of life of the people of puerto rico and to the strategic development of the countrys economy 
 the present fiscal and economic crisis in puerto rico is largely due to the united states colonial power and exploitation in puerto rico 
 further  although puerto rico is a tropical island country seriously being affected by climate change  it is powerless to participate in initiatives and international negotiations to control and mitigate climate change and global warming 
 conclusion as as a colony of the united states  puerto ricos position of political subordination cuts across the problem and independence would break the stalemate and create the possibilities of a solution 
 commitment to grassroots democracy is totally consistent with support for the decolonization of puerto rico as colonialism is contrary to democracy 
 for the country ruled  democracy is non existent where one country rules over another  even if there are elections every four years to elect local authorities 
 taking into account that in puerto rico the united states controls commerce  international relations  immigration  monetary issues  communications  postal matters  defense  labor relations  and others  to truly support democracy in puerto rico  its decolonization has to be supported as the first step for the puerto rican people to live in a democracy 
 kurdistan the kurdish people are the largest ethnic group in the world that is without an independent state 
 as a result  kurdish people have historically suffered persecution and injustice 
 the kurdish people have been besieged to the point of a current humanitarian crisis in towns such as kobani  syria 
 the gpus expresses solidarity for and affirms the right to self determination  self defense  communal autonomy  freedom from persecution  and release of political prisoners for the kurdish population 
 domestic security greens want to stop the assault on our civil liberties that intensified after the attacks of september           and restore these and other freedoms to all people 
 during the last several decades  there has been an erosion of freedom in the united states 
 this has come from many sources and takes many forms  including the war on drugs and widespread imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders  the increased use of personal identification  surveillance of employees at work  and the growing use of private security forces by corporations  restrictions on the speech of protesters and students  and random traffic stops of persons of color and the commonplace use of roadblocks 
 since       this erosion has turned into a collapse of our freedoms  as then president bush authorized torture  illegal wiretapping  indefinite detention without trial  and widespread government surveillance 
 greens believe that all such systematic degradation or elimination of our constitutional protections must stop  and that corrective measures need to be taken in a timely manner by congress to fully reinstate all such losses of guaranteed citizen protections 
 immediately address environmental degradation in all forms 
 environmental degradation poses extremely pressing concerns to both domestic and international security  amongst other things 
 an increasing frequency   intensity of extreme weather events as a whole are stressing global food  water  financial  security  energy  transportation  emigration immigration  and other systems pitting the self interests of normally peaceful nations against each other 
 the green party calls for a complete  thorough  impartial  and independent investigation of the terrorist attacks of september           including the role of the administration of george w  bush  various u 
 based corporations and interests  and other nations and third parties 
 many of its provisions  along with many of the other so called national security acts  undermine and erode our bill of rights  and contribute to the destruction of the democratic foundation of checks and balances between the branches of government 
 strictly enforce our first amendment rights of speech  assembly  association and petition 
 federal  state and local governments must safeguard our right to public  non violent protest 
 it is intolerable that law enforcement agencies intimidate lawful protesters with brutality  surveillance  repression and retaliation 
 end torture  such as in prisons like abu ghraib  guantanamo bay and other u 
 ensure those guilty of ordering or executing torture are held accountable for violations u 
 restore habeas corpus  a legal action to obtain relief from illegal detention 
 end the use of indefinite detention without trial 
 revoke the      re authorization of the patriot act  including  john doe  roving wiretaps and the  library records  provision 
 end the abuse of national security letters  which the fbi uses to force internet service providers  libraries  banks  and credit reporting companies to reveal sensitive information about their patrons 
 end illegal government spying  including the use of warrantless wiretaps 
 three federal judges have ruled that president bushs national security agency warrantless wiretaps violated the foreign intelligence surveillance act  which contains criminal sanctions 
 ensure that anyone who violated the fisa is held accountable for crimes committed 
 enact a constitutional amendment affirming that the rights outlined in our bill of rights are human rights and do not apply in any way to corporations 
 constitutional guarantees for freedom of religion  separation of church and state  and that there shall be no religious test for public office 
 eliminate federal  state  and local laws that discriminate against particular religious beliefs or non belief 
 end faith based initiatives and charitable choice programs  whereby public funds are used to support religious organizations that may not adhere to specified guidelines and standards  including anti discrimination laws 
 oppose the death penalty in the united states and worldwide 
 support students constitutional rights to free speech 
 ensure that government actions towards immigrants comply with our constitution and universal human rights principles 
 support strict fourth amendment protections against illegal search and seizure 
 recognize that the privacy protections of the  th amendment extend to the internet 
 demand the elimination of bulk internet data collection by our government 
 fund and promote research into alternate internet structures that would build in privacy 
 hold criminally accountable all government officials  employees and contractors who illegally spy on americans  and who provide false  misleading or incomplete testimony to congress about surveillance of american communications by law enforcement and intelligence agencies 
 demilitarization and exploration of space the green party recognizes the need for the inspiration and education that the peaceful exploration of space provides  the need for space based systems to monitor environmental conditions on earth  the many advances in space technology that benefit all people on earth  and the inspiration provided to children by space exploration can prompt them to pursue math  science  and other important courses of study 
 the peaceful exploration of space has been usurped by the militarization of space 
backed military conflicts have used space based technology to disrupt the computer and communication systems of sovereign states 
 the funds required for continuing peaceful space exploration have been used  instead  for the design  implementation and deployment of wasteful and dangerous space hardware  such as the strategic defense initiative 
 the green party calls for the end of space militarization and opposes any form of space based military aggression 
 we embrace peaceful space exploration as a means for all people on this planet to work together 
 the benefits of inspired education are well worth the investment in peaceful space exploration 
 the green party supports only the peaceful and sustainable exploration of space  on a case by case  mission specific basis  including the signing of the international treaty for the demilitarization of space 
 the green party advocates a reduction of human staffed space flight due to the high cost and risk for human life and the availability of automated technology that can perform necessary functions in space based research 
 do you like this page  tweet water is essential to all forms of life 
 the green party calls for an international declaration that water belongs to the earth and all of its species 
 government must lead the way in declaring water a fundamental human right and prevent efforts to privatize  export  and sell for profit a substance that is essential to all life 
 the human community is an element of the earth community  not the other way around 
 all human endeavors are situated within the dynamics of the biosphere 
 if we wish to have sustainable institutions and enterprises  they must fit well with the processes of the earth 
 the ideology of industrialism  in both capitalist and communist countries  insists that modern society lives on top of nature and should rightly use and despoil the rest of the natural world as we desire because any loss of the ecosystems is merely an  externality  in economic thought and because any problems can be addressed later by a technological fix 
 we are now living through the painful consequences of that arrogant  ignorant perspective 
 many of our children suffer from accumulations of mercury and other toxins in their neurological systems  environmentally related cancer is on the rise  and our air and water are increasingly polluted 
 meanwhile  our ecosystems are being compromised by the spreading presence of genetically engineered organisms 
 our houses and buildings  manufacturing processes  and industrial agriculture were all designed with the assumption of an endless supply of cheap and readily available fossil fuels 
 pollution and despoiling the land were not part of the thinking 
 the green party  however  is optimistic about the alternatives that now exist and that could be encouraged through tax policy and the market incentives of fuel efficiency 
 we also challenge the grip of the oil  automotive  and automobile insurance industries that have managed to block or roll back progress in public mass transit 
 the gutting of subsidies for the railroads has meant not only fewer passenger routes but also the addition of thousands of large freight trucks on our highways  decreasing public safety and increasing pollution 
 we are committed to extending the greening of waste management by encouraging the spread of such practices as reduce  return  reuse  and recycle 
 we strongly oppose the recent attempts to roll back the federal environmental protection laws that safeguard our air  water  and soil 
 the health of the life support systems the ecosystems on our continent is of paramount importance 
 inherent in the efficient dynamics of those ecosystems is a vital profusion of biodiversity 
 therefore  the greens call for a halt to the destruction of habitats  which are being sacrificed to unqualified economic expansion 
 we humans have a moral responsibility to all of our relations  many of which are facing extinction because we carelessly and permanently halt their long evolutionary journey 
 the green party also supports the spread of organic agriculture and the careful tending of our nations precious remaining topsoil 
 we support planetary efforts to slow the ever increasing numbers of humans pressuring the ecosystems  and we especially support the reduction of consumption of the worlds raw materials by the industrialized northern hemisphere 
 we are appalled by our countrys withdrawal from serious efforts to limit greenhouse gases that are contributing mightily to global climate disruption 
 the green party strongly urges the united states to adopt an actively responsible position in this crisis and to take significant action to address the problem 
 climate change ecosocialist green new deal the green party calls for an ecosocialist green new deal to achieve      clean energy  zero greenhouse gas emissions  and economic security for all within a decade 
 the green new deal will continue to work toward negative emissions to bring the atmospheric greenhouse gases back into the climate safety and stability zone by the end of the   st century 
 the world reached over     ppm in       the highest level in the   
  million years since temperatures were  c   f  hotter and sea levels were    meters     feet  higher than today 
 greens call for a world war ii scale mobilization to carry through this emergency climate program 
 during world war ii  the federal government took over a quarter of us manufacturing capacity in order to turn industry on a dime into what president roosevelt called the arsenal of democracy to defeat the fascist powers 
 we need to do nothing less through the public sector to defeat climate change 
 it is too late for public incentives to private industry such as tax breaks  subsidies  and contracts to make the clean energy transition as the progressive democrats green new deal proposes to do 
 this approach cannot coordinate and integrate the clean energy transition on a rapid timescale across all productive sectorsnot only electric power      of greenhouse gas emissions   but also transportation        manufacturing        buildings        and agriculture       
 private industry will not phase out dirty energy sources as long as its existing plants and equipment are profitable 
 greens call for social ownership and democratic planning in order to make a rapid coordinated transition to      clean energy and zero to negative greenhouse gas emissions 
 this green economy reconstruction program will socialize key productive sectors  notably energy production  power distribution  broadband  railroads and automobiles  a greatly expanded public housing sector  and a domestic manufacturing sector to be rebuilt on an ecological basis of clean power and zero waste 
 the ecosocialist green new deal is an economic justice as well as climate justice program that enacts an economic bill of rights that guarantees living wage jobs  incomes above poverty  affordable housing  quality health care  lifelong public education  and a secure retirement 
 the green economy reconstruction program directly contributes to the goals of the economic bill of rights by providing tens of millions of high quality jobs  and profoundly increasing the overall power of working people by virtually eliminating unemployment  underemployment  and poverty incomes 
 because these publicly created jobs will be union jobs  it will also contribute to the workers power by radically increasing the proportion of unionized workers in the economy 
 declare a climate emergency the president should declare the climate crisis a national emergency  which gives the president powers under existing laws to take many immediate steps to address the climate crisis without needing congressional legislation 
 the president should create a cabinet level office of climate mobilization to coordinate all federal agencies and economic planning to meet climate safety and justice goals 
 the president should then seek congressional legislation to implement an ecosocialist green new deal 
 the key policies and programs in this program should include the following  stop new fossil fuel and other dirty energy infrastructure greens call for a halt to all new fossil fuel infrastructure  fracking  oil and gas pipelines  gas fired power plants  
 existing infrastructure is more than sufficient to deliver fossil fuels during the transition as they are phased out 
 greens also call for a halt to so called low carbon dirty energy industries and for their rapid phase out  including nuclear power  fossil fuel carbon capture and sequestration  waste incinerators  large scale biofuels such as factory farm biogas  landfill gas  and wood pellets  hydrogen from fossil fuels  large scale ecosystem altering hydropower  and market based accounting systems like carbon offsets 
 clean energy includes solar  wind  geothermal  tidal  wave  and small scale hydro 
 public energy system socialize all power generation and distribution utilities and private energy corporations into a public energy system in order to rapidly implement the transition to      clean energy generation and distribution 
 the public energy system will operate at cost for public benefit rather than cost plus profit for owners 
 for profit private utilities will not build the smart grid necessary to incorporate the distributed nature of renewables and to implement energy conservation and efficiency in energy use because the private utilities are more profitable continuing to use the servo mechanical grid based on centralized power plants 
 the public energy system should be governed from the bottom up by a decentralized federation of elected local regional public energy districts that in turn elect state and federal boards for state and federal coordination 
 electrified transportation socialize the railroad and automotive industries into a public transportation system to rapidly electrify transportation powered by clean energy sources 
 the public transportation system should be governed from the bottom up by a decentralized federation of elected local regional public transportation districts that in turn elect state and federal boards for state and federal coordination 
 intra city mass transit and inter city freight rails and high speed passenger rails should move energy  and resource inefficient personal vehicles and freight trucking on roads onto electrified passenger and freight rails 
 urban planning should encourage walkable and bikeable neighborhoods through pedestrian and bike lanes on roads and rezoning single family residence zones into mixed use zones 
 ecological manufacturing build a public manufacturing system that can rebuild manufacturing in the u 
 the public manufacturing system will prioritize developing publicly owned companies for clean energy and zero waste in key industries that must be transformed to reach      clean energy  such as zero carbon cement manufacturing and replacing coke ovens with electric arc furnaces and green hydrogen blast furnaces for steel production 
 the machine tool industry  which builds factory equipment  must be rebuilt in order to build clean energy  zero waste manufacturing equipment for all sectors 
 policy should require that manufacturing products are returned to their manufacturer when used up to be reused and recycled into the next generation of products 
 this zero waste approach includes a rapid phase out of petrochemical plastics and their replacement by biodegradable and inert packaging and product parts  including paper and glass 
 the public manufacturing system should have a training program that enables the workers in these publicly owned companies if they so choose to lease the factories from the public energy system and manage them as worker cooperatives 
 regenerative agriculture the green new deal for agriculture will replace pesticides  chemical fertilizers  and large scale industrialized factory farms based on monocropping and concentrated animal feeding operations with regenerative organic agroecology by working farmers on small and medium sized farms 
 it will ban absentee and corporate ownership of farms and ranches 
 it will subsidize the transition of farmers to organic production 
 it will provide community owned farmland to enable farmers to stay on farms where land prices rise too high 
 it will provide parity pricing and supply management to insure all working farmers have a decent income above their costs of production 
 in coordination with the public manufacturing system  it will provide ecological farm machinery and regional food and fiber processing and manufacturing in farming districts 
 regenerative agriculture will be a major contributor to carbon drawdown by rebuilding carbon rich living soil and integrating the agroecologies of farms into surrounding ecosystems 
 public housing and walkable communities expand public housing until every person has an affordable housing option 
 rehabilitate existing and build new public housing that is powered by clean energy 
 public housing will be open to anyone so that low income  working class  and middle class people live in the same developments and reduce race and class segregation 
 priority placement should be given to low income people as the expanded public housing sector is built out in order to house the homeless as soon as possible 
 coordinate the rehabilitation of existing and the building of new public housing with public transportation and the placement of ecological manufacturing in order to transform urban landscapes into walkable  bikeable communities 
 the public housing system should be governed from the bottom up by a decentralized federation of elected local regional public housing authorities that in turn elect state and federal boards for state and federal coordination 
 develop organic urban farms and farm belts around cities and towns to increase access to fresh food and employment options in agriculture 
 public broadband build a public broadband system providing free internet to all and public cloud systems that allow individuals  government  and organizations to construct public alternatives to near monopolies like amazon web services and facebook 
 universal internet is necessary for equal educational opportunity and access to information as well as implementation of a smart grid for the efficient use of renewable energy sources 
 the public broadband system should be governed from the bottom up by a decentralized federation of elected local regional broadband utility boards that in turn elect state and federal boards for state and federal coordination 
 negative emissions programs create a civilian conservation corps employing several million people in natural carbon sequestration projects that restore biospheric carbon sinks  including forests  soils  wetlands  and mangroves in the u 
 the corps should also work to restore and enhance public recreation and park infrastructure and to clean up hazardous waste sites 
 climate science now recognizes that warming above the   
 c will significantly increase the potential onset of tipping points leading to catastrophic climate change with impacts far worse than we now witness 
 to keep warming below this ipcc recognized target  near future radical reduction of global fossil fuel consumption coupled with negative carbon emissions will be imperative 
 further  the       th ipcc report emphasizes that curbing methane emissions will have significant benefits in slowing down global warming 
 climate security requires negative greenhouse gas emissions and not the net zero goal now promoted by the u 
 net zero is a cover for unaccountable carbon offsets and corporate land grabbing  especially in the global south 
 net zero is an excuse to prolong consumption of fossil fuels and emissions of co  
 because the carbon storing capacity of natural carbon sequestration is uncertain  greens also believe it is prudent to research and develop other ways of drawing carbon out of the atmosphere in order to return to the climate safety zone 
 biospheric carbon sequestration may have to be augmented by geospheric carbon sequestration 
 greens call for research and development of a solar powered industrial acceleration of weathering that fixes carbon in the earths crust in the natural geological carbon cycle 
 demonstration projects have already shown it is feasible to combine water and co  to react chemically in basalt rock formations to create carbonates that fix carbon to the rocks in the earths crust for geological time scales 
 climate and ecological debt acknowledge and pay the climate and ecological debt the u 
 has incurred as the worlds largest historical carbon emitter and destroyer of carbon storing forests  wetlands  and soils 
 climate debt is not only due to its historical emissions 
 it is part of a broader ecological debt from the destruction of carbon storing forests  soils  and wetlands by the resource extracting foreign corporations of the global north that have expropriated the resources  destroyed the biodiversity  and impoverished the people of the global south 
 are linked to this destruction of biodiversity by the globalization of supply chains and trade 
 this ecologically unequal exchange exploits the rainforests  agricultural lands  and fisheries of the global south to provide wood  palm oil  and other food and fiber products to the rich countries 
 is the worlds biggest importer of the tropical products of the global south  which means the u 
 is the top destroyer of carbon storing and ecosystem stabilizing biodiversity 
 paying this climate and ecological debt would not only be reparations to the global south to help those countries make the transition to sustainable clean energy economies 
 paying this debt is also an investment in the habitability of the planet for everyone 
 just transition enact a just transition program that guarantees that workers and communities affected by the transition to clean energy are kept whole during the transition 
 the just transition program will guarantee workers up to five years of their current wages and benefits  or a good pension for early retirement for those who choose it or can no longer work 
 communities that lose tax revenues due the closure of power and manufacturing plants will receive equal revenues until new green new deal plants make up the loss 
 economic bill of rights the ecosocialist green new deal includes an economic bill of rights  job guarantee a public living wage job for those who cannot find work in the private sector 
 income guarantee a guaranteed minimum income above poverty built into the progressive income tax structure as monthly payments to bring people above the poverty line whose incomes are below it 
 housing guarantee an expansion of public housing until every person has an affordable housing option 
 universal health care a single public payer covering all medically necessary services for all 
 lifelong public education tuition free public education from child care and pre k through post secondary college and trade schools 
 secure retirement an increase in social security benefits so every recipient has an income above poverty 
 financing the green new deal the green partys      presidential campaign produced a budget for an ecosocialist green new deal that estimated sector by sector its cost of implementation over ten years  as well as the number of jobs it would create 
 the green economy reconstruction program to reach      clean energy and zero emissions is estimated to be a    year      
 it would create            jobs  including           jobs in manufacturing 
 the economic bill of rights is estimated to cost    
 it would create another           jobs  including         manufacturing jobs 
 the total for the ecosocialist green new deal came to     trillion over ten years 
 total jobs created is             including           manufacturing jobs 
 the ecosocialist green new deal proposes to pay for its program from a variety of short term and long term sources  including  progressive tax reform close tax havens and implement  more  progressive taxes on wealth  estates  personal income  corporate income  and financial transactions 
 ecological taxes the point of ecological taxes is not to raise revenues but reduce pollution and resource destruction 
 if they are successful  they eliminate the source of their revenue 
 as such  they should not be considered long term revenue sources but can be useful for shorter term financing of environmental goals 
 ecological taxes are scarcity rents on the use of natural resources  such as the atmosphere  land  fossil fuels  and mineral resources 
 while ecological taxes are not a substitute for social ownership and economic planning in a green energy transition  they can be part of economic planning to disincentivize fossil fuel use and natural resource extraction  dumping  and depletion 
 three ecological taxes should be instituted to support the ecosocialist green new deal 
 a carbon tax will disincentivize fossil fuel use and do so internationally because carbon taxes function as a tariff on high carbon imports  encouraging firms and nations that want to export products to the us to lower their carbon content 
 land value taxation enables the whole community to benefit from the land values of a limited resource instead of a landowning class 
 its revenues could be dedicated to funding affordable homes  farms  and business locations 
 federal severance taxes on non renewable resources  including reform of the      mining law that now enables corporations to purchase mineral rights on public lands for a mere    an acre and pay no severance tax for minerals taken 
 peace conversion deep cuts in the us military budget on the order of     to     and reallocating the savings into the ecosocialist green new deal 
 public money greens favor monetary reform based on the creation of debt free public money by a monetary authority in the treasury department and spending that money into the economy through the federal budget  including the budget for the ecosocialist green new deal 
 borrowing progressive and ecological taxes and reallocating military spending to the ecosocialist green new deal may not generate enough revenue to make the massive investments immediately needed to rapidly transform the economy to clean energy 
 climate breakdown will cost much more than not making those investments 
 so pending green monetary reform  the federal government may have to borrow to make the needed investments 
 in such borrowing  greens favor a program of green quantitative easing where the federal reserve creates the money to buy the treasury securities issued to support the green new deal investments 
 this quantitative easing by the federal reserve would be used to bail out the planet and the people instead of the big banks as happened in the wake of the great recession 
 public banks greens favor the creation of public banks at the local  state  and federal levels to help finance and target green new deal and other socially beneficial investments 
 sales of public goods and services the ecosocialist green new deal will be producing and selling public goods and services through the public sector and receiving income for them  including power bill payments  transit fees  housing rents  and green machinery leases 
 over time  these revenues should cover the costs of the initial borrowing like any successful business investment 
 strong international climate treaty the climate treaty reached in paris in december       is inadequate to address the climate change crisis 
 the     nations involved pledged to reduce greenhouse gases 
 the treaty does not require the phase out of fossil fuels  and it delays higher aid levels for poorer nations until      
 we call for legally binding commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least     by      and a     reduction by      over      levels 
 economic policy for a safer climate enact a fee   dividend system on fossil fuels to enable the free market to include the environmental costs of their extraction and use 
 these fees shall be applied as far upstream as possible  either when fuel passes from extraction to refining  distribution or consumption  or when it first enters the united states jurisdiction 
 the carbon fee will initially be small  a dime per kilogram of carbon  to avoid creating a shock to the economy 
 the fee will be increased by     each year that global atmospheric carbon dioxide content is greater than     ppm  decreased     each year its less than     ppm  and repealed entirely when it falls below     ppm 
 although imported fossil fuel has no more impact on global climate change than domestic  importing petroleum and natural gas has a catastrophic impact on american foreign policy and the american economy 
 we will enact this same fee on imported fossil fuels a second time to give the free market an incentive to wean america off foreign oil and gas 
 the green party calls for elimination of subsidies for fossil fuels  nuclear power  biomass and waste incineration and biofuels 
 we must also acknowledge that the bulk of our military budget is  in fact  an indirect subsidy for oil   gas corporations 
 to prevent perverse incentives arising from higher carbon prices  the green party mandates clean fuels in addition to pricing carbon 
 otherwise dirty energy sources like nuclear power  biomass and biofuels that are not subject to carbon pricing will become economically competitive 
 repay our climate debt pay for adaptation to climate change in countries with less responsibility for climate change 
 provide a carbon neutral development path for those countries that can no longer be permitted to develop in the same way we didby burning cheap fossil fuels 
 more efficiency and conservation adopt energy efficiency standards that reduce energy demand economy wide by     over the next      years 
 can make massive reductions in its energy use through a combination of conservation and efficiency measures 
 instead  we can and should reduce our consumption of power 
 build an efficient  low cost public transportation system 
 the best incentive we can provide to live closer to work and reduce the use of private vehicles is to make the alternative inexpensive and convenient to use 
 the less we consume and throw away  the less we will need to produce and replace 
 clean  green energy and jobs create an inclusive program to train workers for the new  clean energy economy 
 focusing on both the environment and social justice  prioritize the creation of green jobs in communities of color and low income communities 
 transition to     percent renewable energy by      using wind  solar  ocean  small scale hydro  and geothermal power 
 nuclear energy is massively polluting  dangerous  financially risky  expensive and slow to implement 
 our money is better spent on wind  solar  geothermal  conservation and small scale hydroelectric 
  many of the  solutions  offered in climate legislation arent real solutions 
 biomass incineration  trees  crops  construction debris and certain types of waste   landfill gas and many types of biofuels will dump massive quantities of toxic pollutants into the air and water  and some of these energy sources produce more greenhouse gas emissions than coal 
 natural gas is primarily methane  which is    times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas 
 consequently  when pipeline leakage is considered  the clean burning characteristics of natural gas can be lost  resulting in a fuel with climate impacts as bad as coal 
 biomass and biofuels will also increase deforestation  contributing to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
 regenerative agriculture end industrialized agriculture methods  including monocropping  reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides  and the use of confined animal operations  all of which are high order contributors to atmospheric greenhouse gases 
 convert our food producing systems to small scale organic  regenerative agriculture  agroecology  systems to restore soil health  sequester carbon  foster biodiversity  discourage the currently unsustainable level of meat consumption  and secure robust ecosystem services for a sustainable future 
 replace subsidization of industrially produced agricultural products with support for small producers employing organic  regenerative agricultural methods 
 localize food distribution systems to minimize waste  build rural communities  and eliminate reliance on fossil fuels 
 carbon sequestration using ecological restoration to stabilize the climate  limiting emissions is not enough  carbon must be removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in the ground 
 ecological restoration is a valuable tool to achieve this and it will increase the quality of living for all 
 when forests  grasslands  and farmlands are restored  they act as carbon sinks and improve the health of the soil 
 greens support creating a federal program under the environmental protection agency  epa  for carbon sequestration to fund local public initiatives that  plant trees  reforest and afforest public lands revegetate grasslands with native species to prevent desertification and improve climate resilience encourage the use of regenerative agricultural techniques restore ecosystems on privately owned lands by providing incentives to landowners 
 energy the united states has a high energy consumption economy based mainly on fossil energy 
 the extraction  refining  and combustion of fossil fuels have proved extremely harmful to the environment  and supplies are rapidly being depleted 
 over the past century  the infrastructure of our civilization has become utterly dependent on plentiful oil  coal  and natural gas  vast land  air  and sea transportation networks  increasing dependence on imported goods  industrialized food production dependent on fertilizer and biocides  and sprawling  car dependent neighborhoods and workplaces 
 our electric grid depends on fossil fuels for two thirds of its energy 
 dirty and dangerous energy sources have generated an unparalleled assault on the environment and human rights 
  low income communities and communities of color bear the greatest burden of health impacts due to exposure to emissions from coal and gas fired power plants 
 native american communities have been devastated by uranium mining  and the people of appalachia watch helplessly as their ancient mountains are destroyed for coal fired electricity 
 regional and global peaks in supply are driving up costs and threatening wars and social chaos 
   see section on climate change  above   since      when the first commercial oil well was drilled in pennsylvania  the global community has consumed about half what nature generated over hundreds of millions of years 
 although coal is more abundant than oil  it is inherently dirtier than oil  is limited in terms of its use as a vehicle fuel  and demand is skyrocketing globally for use in electricity generation 
 natural gas is also in high demand for power production and is ultimately finite 
 we must plan and prepare for the end of fossil fuels now  while we still have energy available to build the cleaner  more sustainable energy infrastructure that we will soon need 
 to simply substitute better energy sources in place of fossil fuels is not the answer for two main reasons 
 first  there are no energy sources  renewable or otherwise  capable of supplying energy as cheaply and in such abundance as fossil fuels currently yield in the time that we need them to come online 
 second  we have designed and built our infrastructure to suit the unique characteristics of oil  natural gas  and coal 
 the energy transition cannot be accomplished with a minor retrofit of existing energy infrastructure 
 just as our fossil fuel economy differs from the agrarian economy of       the post fossil fuel economy of      will be profoundly different from all that we are familiar with now 
 changes would occur if we wait for the price of fossil fuels to reflect scarcity  forcing society to adapt  however  lack of government planning will result in a transition that is chaotic  painful  destructive  and possibly not survivable 
 the green party advocates a rapid reduction in energy consumption through energy efficiency and a decisive transition away from fossil and nuclear power toward cleaner  renewable  local energy sources 
 encourage conservation encourage conservation and a significant decrease in our energy consumption  institute national energy efficiency standards 
s residents consume twenty six percent of the worlds energy 
 consumption of electricity is almost nine times greater than the average for the rest of the world 
 must retrofit its building stock for energy efficiency 
 residents live in homes that require heat during the winter  and most are inadequately insulated 
 buildings in the south require air conditioning during the summer 
 fuel shortages  power outages  and energy price hikes could bring not just discomfort  but a massive increase in mortality from cold and heat 
 millions of buildings can and must be super insulated and  as much as possible  provided with alternative heat sources  passive solar  geothermal  or district heating  
 energy efficiency standards similar to those in california must be adopted nationally 
 the energy efficiency standards adopted there in the late     s have resulted in overall electricity use remaining flat over the past three decades while the population has steadily increased 
 during the same time period electricity use in the rest of the u 
 there are many different ways to increase energy efficiency and the best path for one region of the country might differ from that of another 
 we will need concerted effort to increase efficiency in every sector of our economy 
 technologies exist that  if widely implemented  can result in huge energy savings 
 cogeneration and use of waste heat to generate electricity should be encouraged 
 a carbon tax  which the green party supports  would serve as an important market incentive to increase efficiency 
 move to renewable sources move decisively to an energy system based on solar  wind  geo thermal  marine  and other cleaner renewable energy sources 
 the development of earth gentle  sustainable energy sources must be a cornerstone of any plan to reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuels 
 the green party advocates clean renewable energy sources such as solar  wind  geothermal  marine based  and other cleaner renewable sources as the long term solution 
 many other solutions being pushed  including nuclear power  coal  industrial scale biofuels  and low grade fossil fuels such as oil shale and tar sands  create more problems than they solve 
 further research with increased government support is needed into new energy storage technologies  as well as new cheaper and non toxic photovoltaic materials and processes  and new geothermal and ocean power technologies 
 policy tools to directly support the development of renewable energy sources  such as renewable portfolio standards  rps  and feed in tariffs  should also be reviewed for effectiveness 
 in general  a feed in tariff is legislation enacted by the government that requires the large electric utilities to guarantee a price for the renewably generated electricity fed into the grid 
 when done right  such as in germany  this policy appears to succeed in harnessing entrepreneurial zeal 
 state level financing policies like californias ab     can help homeowners install expensive renewable energy where the county pays the up front cost and the system is paid for via the homeowners property taxes 
 greens support voluntary purchase of tradable renewable energy certificates  however  voluntary approaches are not sufficient 
 greens support research into advanced fuels when the purpose of the research is to develop a fuel that in its full cycle does not create more problems than it solves 
 we support the use of hydrogen as an energy storage medium  however we oppose the use of nuclear technologies or carbon based feedstocks for hydrogen production 
 we call for a ban on the construction of large scale and inappropriately located  hydroelectric dams 
 eliminate dirty   dangerous energy sources the green party advocates the phase out of nuclear and coal power plants 
 all processes associated with nuclear power are dangerous  from the mining of uranium to the transportation and disposal of the radioactive waste 
 coal is the largest contributor to climate change with estimates as high as     
 it is hazardous for thousands of years and there is no way to isolate it from the biosphere for the duration of its toxic life 
 cost is another huge factor making it unfeasible  with each new nuclear power plant costing billions of dollars 
 the green party calls for a formal moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants  the early retirement of existing nuclear power reactors  and the phase out of technologies that use or produce nuclear waste  such as nuclear waste incinerators  food irradiators  and all uses of depleted uranium 
 we call for a ban on mountaintop removal coal mining 
 with limited supplies and in the absence of commercially viable  clean coal  carbon sequestration  which may never be feasible  coal is neither an economically nor an environmentally sustainable solution 
 we call for the cessation of development of fuels produced with polluting  energy intensive processes or from unsustainable or toxic feed stocks  such as genetically engineered crops  coal and waste streams contaminated with persistent toxics 
 we oppose further oil and gas drilling or exploration on our nations outer continental shelf  on our public lands  in the rocky mountains  and under the great lakes 
 due to serious negative impacts on food  soil  and water  we oppose industrial scale biofuels production and biomass burning for electric power generation 
 we approve small scale distributed production under local control  such as production of biodiesel from waste oils  production of charcoal and byproducts from wood wastes or sustainably harvested wood  small scale production of ethanol from crop wastes or maize stalk sugar  or production of fuel gas for localized electricity generation from anaerobic methane digesters or charcoal gasifiers 
 we do not object to the utilization of fuel gases seeping from landfills  as that is one way to reduce air pollution 
 we support as a minimum standard the principles for sustainable biomass statement signed by clean water action  environmental defense fund  environmental working group  friends of the earth  geos institute  greenpeace usa  national wildlife federation  natural resources defense council  southern alliance for clean energy  southern environmental law center  union of concerned scientists  the wilderness society  and world wildlife fund 
 the green party stands for the enactment of bans on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil on the local  state and federal level and stands for bans on the disposal of wastes created by the fracking industry 
 decentralize the grid plan for decentralized  bioregional electricity generation and distribution 
 decentralized power systems are likely to be more resilient in the face of power disruptions and will cut transmission losses  assure citizens greater control of their power grids  and prevent the massive ecological and social destruction that accompanies production of electricity in mega scale projects 
 the federal government must step in to set goals and standards and to provide capital 
 this effort must not favor commercial utilities over municipal power districts 
 the green party supports net metering to make decentralized energy production economically viable 
 greens support tax exempt bonds to finance public ownership of utilities and to allow publicly owned utilities to finance conservation and renewable energy projects 
 re localize the food system de carbonize and re localize the food system 
 our national industrial food system is overwhelmingly dependent upon oil and natural gas for farm equipment fuel  fertilizer  pesticides  herbicides  and the transport 
 it is responsible for over     of all greenhouse gases from human activities in the u 
 new farming methods  new farmers  and a re localization of production and distribution are needed 
 these will require land reform  an investment in revitalizing rural areas and the creation of local food processing plants and storage centers 
 laws and incentives affecting the food system  including food safety laws and farm subsidies  will need to be rewritten to provide preferential support for small scale  local  low input producers 
 electrify the transportation system our enormous investment in highways  airports  cars  buses  trucks  and aircraft is almost completely dependent on oil  and it will be significantly handicapped by higher fuel prices  and devastated by actual fuel shortages 
 the electrification of road based vehicles is a must and will require at least two decades to fully deploy and we must move to earth gentle electricity generation to charge the vehicles 
 meanwhile  existing private automobiles must be put to use more efficiently through carpooling  car sharing  and ride sharing networks 
   see transportation section below for more  including need for dramatic increase in cafe or gasoline efficiency standards     
 requirements for energy transition investment  enormous amounts of investment capital will be needed to accomplish the energy transition  much more than the promise of      billion for renewable energy over ten years  and must now come from government 
 coordination  the energy transition will be complex and comprehensive  and its various strategies will be mutually impacting 
 for example  efforts to redirect transport away from highways and toward rail service will need to be coordinated with manufacturers  farmers  retailers  and employers 
 an independent federal energy transition office should track and manage the transition 
 education  community colleges should prepare workers for new job opportunities  e 
  sustainable food production  renewable energy installation  grid rebuilding  rail expansion  public transport construction  and home energy retrofitting 
 grade school curriculum should include gardening programs in all schools and increased emphasis on energy conservation 
 public messaging   goal setting  our leaders must instill in the nation a sense of collective struggle and of a long journey toward a clear goal 
 the success of a project of this scope will require public buy in at every stage and level  including the use of language and images to continually underscore what is at stake  to foster a spirit of cooperation and willing sacrifice 
 business leaders  advertising agencies and even hollywood must be enlisted  a quid pro quo for government bail out of banks and corporations 
 grassroots initiatives  such as the transition towns movement  could lead the way toward voluntary community efforts 
 a sophisticated  interactive  web based program would inspire action and provide resources 
 ratepayers should get full disclosure of the specific electric generating facilities used to produce their electricity 
 a series of challenging yet feasible targets should be set  with the ultimate goalcomplete freedom from fossil fuel dependency to be achieved by      
 nuclear issues we condemn the nuclear regulatory commissions  nrc  blatant attempt to hijack the term s   green    green energy    green power  in reference to nuclear power for the purpose of promoting so called new advanced nuclear reactors and relicensing aging conventional reactors under the guise of sustainability 
 this misinformation depicts nuclear power as carbon free  in denial of the mining  milling  manufacturing  and transportation of the fuel and its environmental footprint 
 we see it as a step in the direction of diverting funding from true renewables and efficiency to bolstering the nuclear industry 
 nuclear power is not a benign operation that would be classified as clean or sustainable if the truth was being told 
 we recognize that there is no such thing as nuclear waste  disposal 
  all six of the  low level  nuclear waste dumps in the united states have leaked 
 department of energy  doe  halted operations at the waste isolation pilot plant  wipp   the countrys first nuclear waste repository dedicated to the weapons complex  situated in southern new mexico  due to two incidents in      
 the doe has projected that wipps current capacity will reach its limit by approximately      
 additionally  the doe is confronted with a legal cap on the volume of waste that can be deposited at wipp 
 therefore  it is imperative to permanently seal off the repository chambers  implement continuous monitoring  and address the challenge of managing the radioactive waste currently stored on site 
 there are no technological quick fixes that can effectively isolate nuclear waste from the biosphere for the duration of its hazardous life 
 therefore  it is essential that generation of additional nuclear wastes be stopped 
 we call for the early retirement of nuclear power reactors as soon as possible and for a phase out of other technologies that use or produce nuclear waste 
 these technologies include non commercial nuclear reactors  reprocessing facilities  nuclear waste incinerators  and food irradiators 
 we strongly object to the utilization of depleted uranium in military applications  including its incorporation into bullet tips  artillery shells  and as armor for tanks and other armed vehicles 
 furthermore  we disapprove of its use as counterweights in nuclear weaponry or for adjusting the yield of nuclear explosions through modifications in the weapons internal components 
 current methods of underground storage are a danger to present and future generations 
 we call for the discontinuation of the use of thin walled canisters for the storage of high level radioactive wastes and spent fuel 
 these     to     thick welded sheet canisters can be developed undetected and cannot be prevented from leaking or explosions 
 each of the       loaded canisters contains approximately the same amount of radiation as was released in the      chernobyl explosion 
 the nuclear regulatory commission  nrc  has proposed to transport these canisters by rail through municipalities and countryside to an interim storage facility where they cannot be maintained  monitored  or repaired 
 any nuclear waste management strategy must be based on waste containers being stored above ground and continuously monitored  and the containers must be retrievable and capable of being repackaged 
 all such strategies must also minimize the transportation of wastes 
 we strongly oppose any shipment of high level nuclear waste across the u 
 to any proposed  interim storage  facility or to the previously proposed nevada waste repository at yucca mountain  or any other centralized facility 
 we believe that this proposal is part of a move to re fire a fast track  commercial nuclear industry by providing a means for  safe disposal 
  we deny there is such a thing as safe disposal of nuclear waste 
 we propose making spent reactor fuel and other high level wastes safe by vitrification at the site where it is produced or now stored 
 we oppose the use of unaccountable quasi governmental authorities in the nuclear industry with industry biased structures and limited or no public oversight 
 we call for all aspects of nuclear regulation  radiation monitoring and waste management to be subject to transparent  democratic processes with full public participation and independent scientific review at all nuclear facilities 
 we condemn the history of criminal activities by nuclear corporations  including bribery of legislators and regulators  and call for comprehensive reforms to prevent such abuses 
  see social justice  consumer protection  we support an immediate and intensive campaign to educate the public about nuclear problems  including disposal  cleanup  and long term dangers 
 we oppose the risch manchin bipartisan civil nuclear export act of      that would allow mass exports of weapons proliferating small modular reactors  smrs  we oppose public subsidies for nuclear power  including price anderson insurance caps and stranded cost recovery bailouts 
 we oppose federal loan guarantees to enable the construction of a new generation of nuclear reactors 
 we oppose the development and use of new nuclear reactors  including so called advanced reactors and small modular reactors  smrs   plutonium  mox  fuel  nuclear fuel reprocessing  nuclear fusion  uranium enrichment  and the manufacturing of new plutonium pits for a new generation of nuclear weapons 
 we oppose the deregulation of radioactive materials and wastes  which is allowing such wastes to be recycled into consumer products and to enter municipal waste landfills and incinerators 
 we call for the strict regulation  tracking  monitoring  and recapturing of radioactive materials and wastes 
 we call for the immediate extension and expansion of the radiation exposure compensation act  reca  to provide jurisdiction and procedures for claims for compassionate payments for injuries due to exposure to radiation from nuclear testing 
we oppose granting patents for engineering that creates or refines nuclear weapon technology  or that facilitates the further proliferation of nuclear power reactors here and around the world 
  see economic justice  advanced technology  d 
 transportation the green party supports a transportation policy that emphasizes the use of mass transit and alternatives to the automobile and truck for transport 
 we call for major public investment in mass transportation  so that such systems are cheap or free to the public and are safe  accessible  and easily understandable to first time users 
 we need ecologically sound forms of transportation that minimize pollution and maximize efficiency 
 surfaces impermeable to rainwater  polluted storm run off  paved over or polluted wetlands  the heat island effect  air pollution  and acid rain are all directly related to a transportation system run amuck 
 massive subsidies to the auto and fossil fuel industries  as well as an unworkable approach by urban planners  maintain the autos dominance of our cityscapes 
 the present day approach of upgrading streets to accommodate increased traffic generates new traffic because access is now easier  and people will now take jobs further from their homes or purchase homes further from their jobs 
 some people shift from public transit to private cars due to the trip time in cars being shorter 
 as patronage for public transit decreases  public transit loses funding  becomes less viable  and service deteriorates thus encouraging even more people to use their cars 
 to counteract these trends and reduce auto use  the green party advocates the following strategies    
 pedestrians and bicyclists make streets  neighborhoods and commercial districts more pedestrian friendly 
 utilize traffic calming methods  where the design of streets promotes safe speeds and safe interaction with pedestrians 
 develop extensive networks of bikeways  bicycle lanes and paths 
 maintain free community bicycle fleets  and provide necessary support for cyclists 
 mass transit redirect resources that currently go to enhancing auto capacity into expanding human scale transit options 
 develop affordable mass transit systems that are more economical to use than private vehicles 
 encourage employer subsidies of transit commuter tickets for employees  funded by government congestion management grants 
 use existing auto infrastructure for transit expansion where possible 
 light rail could be established in expressway medians through metropolitan high density corridors 
 include land use decisions in transportation issues  with consideration of the need for mass transit to have a market and be viable  and with attention paid to crosscommuting the practice of people commuting to a place where they could and should live 
 expand our countrys network of rail lines  including high speed regional passenger service 
 transfer ownership and operation of all intercity railroad trackage currently under control of freight railroads to responsible and adequately funded public agencies  as is done with highways  to provide for efficiency and safety of all rail traffic 
 motor vehicles place a moratorium on highway widening  appropriating funds instead for mass transit and facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists 
 mandate hov  high occupancy vehicle  lanes on freeways  and lower tolls for carpools 
 discourage unnecessary auto use by eliminating free parking in non residential areas well served by mass transit  and establish preferential parking rates for hov 
 regularly increase corporate average fuel economy  cafe  standards to levels which truly challenge automakers to improve the state of the art  using the fuel economy performance of vehicles worldwide for reference 
 eliminate the distinction between cars and light trucks  the footprint loophole  the e   loophole and the      pound exemption 
 eliminate the perverse incentives for alternative fuels that increase the nations petroleum consumption 
 enact a fee   dividend system on the carbon content of gasoline  diesel fuel and e   
 enact a fuel economy based federal sales tax that creates a significant incentive for people to select more efficient vehicles  and for automakers to make them available in the united states 
 lead by example  using government procurement to put more high efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles into service 
 electrify truck stops  freight terminals and loading docks 
 idling engines consume nearly a billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel and emit ten million tons of carbon dioxide annually       data  
 encourage carpooling programs  telecommuting  and other creative solutions to reduce commuter traffic congestion 
 remove the most polluting vehicles from the road by requiring every vehicle to comply with the emission standards in effect when it was manufactured before issuing or renewing its license 
 air travel aviation contributes around    to human induced global warming  more than most countries do 
 this problem has multiple parts  including government  business and personal travel  and the global supply chain which ships cargo by air 
 due to technological progress  much travel for meetings and conferences could take place online  eliminating those air trips 
 we propose the following actions to reduce air travel greenhouse gas emissions  as one part of the solution to the life threatening problem of climate change  continue government travel policy guidelines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from government travel 
 provide incentives to reduce business and conference air travel 
 provide incentives to improve technology for virtual meetings 
 enact tax deductions for investments in virtual meeting equipment 
 repeal tax deductions for business and conference travel 
 provide incentives for the development of alternative long distance  fuel efficient travel 
 make airports accessible by local transit systems 
 legislate further incremental reductions in airplane noise and air pollution 
 emphasize the use of light and heavy rail for freight transportation 
 freight we call for incentives to get long distance truck hauling off of our highways and on to railways 
 we favor the removal of any administrative impediments to efficient long haul freight transport by rail 
 time is lost when switching goods from one railroad to another  even when the trains are the same size and gauge  and this waste can be eliminated 
 our position greens will shift our nation toward clean production and principles of zero waste 
 a waste free society is essential to public health and the integrity and sustainability of the biosphere 
 natural ecosystems are self sustaining and generate no waste 
 we humans are a part of these ecosystems  and while we obtain resources from them  we have a responsibility to return only those things that can be re absorbed without detriment 
 waste is not an inevitable part of production and consumption  as it is viewed in the current economic model 
 green solutions phase out all avoidable production and sale of toxic metals  persistent organic pollutants  persistent bio accumulative toxins  synthetic petrochemicals  and halogenated chemicals 
 make manufacturers responsible for the full life cycle of their products by requiring them to take back used products and packaging for remanufacturing  reuse  or recycling 
 support and implement the precautionary principle   when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment  precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically 
 in this context the proponent of an activity  rather than the public  should bear the burden of proof 
 the process of applying the precautionary principle must be open  informed and democratic and must include potentially affected parties 
 it must also involve an examination of the full range of alternatives  including no action 
  strengthen right to know laws so that everyone can discover what toxic or potentially toxic chemicals are used and released in their communities  and in products that they might purchase or use 
 hold corporations strictly liable for the consequences of the pollution they produce 
 we support the citizens platform on superfund  as adopted at the      comunities at risk superfund summit in washington  dc 
 end the use of incineration as a cleanup technology  and ensure that  cleanups  dont simply relocate toxins to chemical waste dumps in poor communities of color 
 shut down existing waste incinerators  impose a moratorium on new waste incinerators  and phase out landfills 
 for all possible waste streams  we support the following strategies  in order of priority  as alternatives to incineration and landfills   a  toxics use reduction   b  source reduction  reuse  clean recycling or composting  digestion  or  c  neutralization  sterilization or detoxification methods where applicable 
 do not deregulate wastes containing toxic or radioactive contaminants significantly above background levels 
 they should not be allowed to be used in  beneficial use  schemes as fertilizer   co products   or fuels  or by  recycling  them into consumer products  including construction materials  or disposing of them as municipal waste 
 do not export  under any circumstances  chemicals that are prohibited in the united states 
 we oppose shipping of toxic  hazardous  or radioactive wastes across national borders  and the shipment of such wastes without strict regulation across any political borders 
 waste should not be considered a tradable commodity under the interstate commerce clause 
 safe  secure  above ground storage for existing nuclear waste 
 we oppose exporting nuclear waste to other nations 
 strict regulation of radioactive materials and wastes and prohibiting such wastes to be recycled into consumer products and to enter municipal waste landfills and incinerators 
 close  clean up and remediate at national labs devoted to nuclear energy and weapons development and operations at the department of energys nuclear production sites 
 clean up depleted uranium contamination from testing ranges and battlefields  and provide generously compensate veterans and civilians who have been sickened by depleted uranium exposure 
 require independent  transparent radiation monitoring at all nuclear facilities 
 substitute chemical safety testing on animals with alternatives that do not use animals  wherever such alternative tests or testing strategies are available 
 clean air and ozone depletion the strict  comprehensive protections of the clean air act must be maintained and enhanced if we are to keep in place effective federal programs that deal with urban smog  toxic air pollution  acid rain  and ozone depletion 
 state and local clean air initiatives should advance and improve national efforts  for example  moving forward with stricter clean air and fuel efficiency standards  and with vehicle and fleet conversions 
 gpus recognizes the positive contributions for controlling ozone destroying substances that have been made by the montreal protocol of      and subsequent amendments thereto 
 some of the chemical replacements for cfcs also damage the ozone layer or are potent greenhouse gases 
 these include hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs  and very short lived substances  vsls  such as dichloromethane and other chlorine gases 
 gpus supports further research on the damaging effects of vsls on the ozone layer and finding replacements for those causing destruction of ozone  and immediately phasing out their use 
 we call for updated amendments to the montreal protocol to keep it consistent with current scientific findings regarding threats to the ozone layer 
 land use our position land use policies must promote sustainable development and respect ecology 
 unlimited growth on a finite planet cannot be sustained 
 there is a fundamental difference between growth and development and between quantity and quality 
 rather than exploiting the earth for short term gain  greens believe in living in sustainable balance with it 
 land use practices must be founded on stewardship of the earth  to honor the interconnected and interdependent nature of all life  to respect ecosystems and other species  while at the same time providing for human needs in a responsible and sustainable way 
 only an economics that is based upon environmental health is sustainable 
 green solutions land ownership and property rights insist that every property right has an implied responsibility to provide for the common good of people  places and the planet 
 encourage the formation and operation of cooperatives  non profits  land trusts  co housing  and other forms of communal and public interest management of land and resources 
 urban land use promote livable urban environments to minimize urban sprawl 
 promote urban infill with affordable housing  mass transit  schools  jobs  health care  public spaces  bicycle and walking paths  community gardens  open spaces  parks  playgrounds  and urban growth boundaries

 the green party calls for an international declaration that water belongs to the earth and all of its species 
 government must lead the way in declaring water a fundamental human right and prevent efforts to privatize  export  and sell for profit a substance that is essential to all life 
 according to the united nations  more than one billion people lack access to safe drinking water 
 if current trends persist  by      as much as two thirds of the worlds population will be living with a serious scarcity of water 
 multinational corporations recognize these trends and are moving fast to monopolize water supplies around the world 
 they argue that privatizing water is the best way to allocate this valuable resource  and they are scheming to have water declared a human need so that it can be commodified and sold on the open market ensuring that the allocation of water will be based on principles of scarcity and profit maximization 
 with water sold to the highest bidder  the rich will have plenty while the poor will be left with little but polluted water 
 short term profits will preclude any concern for long term sustainability 
 we must stop this privatization before the infrastructures become so established that it will be impossible to avoid a disaster of epic proportions 
 governments are signing away their control over their domestic water supplies by participating in trade treaties such as the north american free trade agreement and in institutions such as the world trade organization 
 the world bank recently adopted a policy of water privatization and full cost water pricing 
 we need strong national and international laws to promote conservation  reclaim polluted water systems  develop water supply restrictions  ban toxic and pesticide dumping  control or ban corporate farming  and bring the rule of law to transnational corporations that pollute water systems 
 mining and depleting the present underground aquifers must be severely restricted 
 implement strong laws to promote conservation  reclaim polluted water systems  develop water supply restrictions  ban toxics and pesticide dumping  control corporate farming  and bring the rule of law to trans state and trans national operations that pollute water systems greens oppose the privatization of water and demand that the u 
 government pass strong laws with effective enforcement mechanisms to assure a safe and adequate supply of water for its citizens and all life within its borders 
 decisions about water must be based on an ecosystems approach 
 use an ecosystems watershed approach to ensure responsible water use 
 all stakeholders need to participate in the planning 
 environmental justice  ecological impact  and depletion of groundwater supplies need to be integrated with the ongoing process for approval of new withdrawals cycles of intense drought and flooding have demonstrated the need to reorient our priorities in order to achieve a truly sustainable water policy 
 over development and poor planning have resulted in increasing rain impermeable areas  which compounds the severity and frequency of flooding and pollution in regions downstream 
 we must begin to understand and apply a holistic watershed approach to managing our water resources 
 the principle of bioregionalism  living within the means of a regions natural resources  should give direction to future water policies 
 conservation must be an essential part of any water policy 
 water conservation also reduces energy consumption and pollution 
 to conserve water  the green party proposes to  mandate water efficient appliances and fixtures be used in all new construction  and promote retrofitting of older buildings 
 promote native landscaping and other drought resistant  climate appropriate plants  in order to reduce the need for irrigation 
 promote drip irrigation systems where irrigation is necessary 
 eliminate storm water pollution of our water resources through education of our citizens  enforcement of our laws  and holistic watershed management 
 promote storm water technologies that detain  treat  filtrate  and use storm waters near where it is collected 
 promote the appropriate reuse of the  gray  and  black  waters we produce 
 use separation techniques  such as dual piping systems where pure water is used for drinking and washing  and reclaimed water is used for lawn watering and similar purposes 
 mandate pre treatment of industrial wastes to eliminate the presence of metals  solvents  and other toxins in sewer water 
 this would reduce the cost of municipal treatment and encourage wastewater reuse 
 promote and maintain passive and natural systems  such as wetlands  for water and wastewater treatment where appropriate  and enforce regulations against dumping of pollutants through regional water quality control boards 
 eliminate water subsidies for corporate agribusiness 
 higher water prices give agribusiness incentives to conserve 
 assist community organizations to monitor the use of local resources  and to oversee the enforcement of water quality regulations 
 preserve and restore the nations natural water features  streams  rivers  lakes  bays  wetlands and groundwater aquifers  that are vital to achieving sustainable use of water resources 
 set health and sustainability water quality guidelines for drinking water supported by the peer reviewed scientific literature 
 regulations are needed or need improvement  for example  for arsenic  bacteria  viruses  protozoa  fluoridation chemical species such as fluoride and fluorosilicate  water disinfection by products  environmental estrogens  and pharmaceuticals  medicines  
 achieve a truly sustainable water policy in the light of climate change considering  for example  snow packs  aquifer recharge  rising sea levels  and available water supplies 
 oppose the disproportional political influences of the petroleum  corporate agriculture  mining  timber  real estate and development industries  while working to support family farms  open space  the protection of water quality in our rivers  conservation of watersheds  and the sustainable use and preservation of healthy forest 
 integrate land use with water use for urban planning decisions 
 political bodies  such as municipal water authorities  need to be more inclusive in the representation of users  hydrologists  environmental health professionals  and environmental advocates in the region and address the issues affecting the regional supply and demand of the resource  as well as water quality 
 presently  the interests and concerns of real estate and development interests have a disproportionate voice in new allocations 
 ensure that municipal water and water systems are publicly owned  publicly sourced from the cleanest natural sources possible  obtained and discharged without harming the bioregions ecosystem  transported using safe  uncontaminated systems and materials  and treated using scientific methods to render water uncontaminated and safe to drink without health hazard 
 promptly assess and replace lead pipes in the nations municipal infrastructure 
 comprehensive water testing and analysis that includes a wide range of contaminants and radioactivity should be done throughout the municipality and the results published promptly and publicly 
 public health issues should promptly inform and coincide with water testing 
 using privatized  bottled water to substitute for a contaminated public water supply is unacceptable 
 since water is a human right  all humans within the municipality should have full access to affordable  clean  uncontaminated water from the municipal water system for basic needs at all times and without threat of shut off 
 it is imperative that we protect the waters and shorelines of the great lakes  and greens strongly urge the following actions  allocate funds to help upgrade and phase out aging municipal sewage systems and treatment plants  have mandatory inspections  and allow for composting and greywater system alternatives to septic systems 
 prohibit municipalities from dumping sewage into the great lakes with a zero discharge mandate 
 set clear and enforceable deadlines and standards for reducing nutrient runoff from agricultural lands 
 devise and implement a plan to stop the release of flame retardants and other toxins into the great lakes without further delay 
 immediately decommission and shut down the aging enbridge line   oil and gas pipeline under the straits of mackinac as it poses an unacceptable risk to the waters of lake huron and lake michigan 
 prevent the opening of a new sulfide mining district in northern wisconsin and michigans western upper peninsula to protect the waters of lake michigan and lake superior from the inevitable pollution that would be caused by acid mine drainage from such mining 
 require ocean going freighters to filter or treat their ballast water to meet high environmentally protective standards 
 close the chicago sanitary and ship canal to prevent asian carp from entering the great lakes 
 stop the dumping of toxins by petroleum refineries into the great lakes by making it unlawful 
 such dumping is currently allowed and administered by the epa through the purchase of permits or licenses 
 have the federal government buy and protect more undeveloped areas of great lakes coastlines by designating them as national lakeshores 
 encourage the planting of buffer strips of vegetation to act as natural filters of toxins and contaminants  prevent erosion  and provide species habitat between waterways and developed land 
 agriculture food is a necessity and a fundamental human right 
 all people have a right to adequate  safe  nutritional and high quality food  and those who grow it have a right to a fair return for their labor 
 the united states industrialized agriculture system is highly destructive of our environment  of our peoples health  and of our societys future 
 unless it changes radically  we face desertification  ecosystem collapse  mass extinctions  and starvation 
 our civilization itself is threatened by the loss of the ecosystem services on which it depends for its existence 
 moreover  agriculture is the high order term in climate change  not only because of the amount of carbon it contributes to the atmosphere  but more importantly because of the vital role it could play in sequestering carbon and restoring a healthy carbon cycle 
  regenerative agriculture   also called  agroecology  refers to a suite of holistic principles and methods that together have the proven potential to rapidly restore our rural and natural environments to full health  sequestering vast quantities of carbon  restoring ecological balance and biodiversity  building soil  and reversing desertification  all while producing more food of a higher quality 
 it also has the potential to restore agricultural communities to economic independence and security 
 the principles of regenerative agriculture are promoted by the united nations food and agriculture organization  un fao  and by an increasing number of academic institutions involved in agricultural and sustainability research 
 in addition to its positive environmental effects  the adoption of regenerative agriculture throughout the food system will put a stop to unethical confined animal operations  improve the diversity and nutritional content of our food  and rationalize the pricing and distribution of food 
 we call for legislation that assists new and existing farmers and ranchers to convert their operations to regenerative agricultural methods that promote widespread ownership of small and medium sized farms and ranches  and that revitalizes and repopulates rural communities and promotes sustainable development and stewardship 
 we call for legislation that recognizes  through appropriate regulation  foods that are produced using regenerative methods  including no till minimum till  natural soil building techniques  development of natural soil biomes  and set asides for wildlife alongside cultivated areas 
 we advocate regionalizing our food system and decentralizing agriculture lands  production and distribution 
 we encourage public support for producer and consumer cooperatives  community kitchens  community supported agriculture  urban agriculture  and community farms and gardens 
 we advocate the creation of a food policy council composed of farmers  including small farmers and consumers  to oversee the usda and all food policies at the local  state  and national level 
 this council should adjudicate conflicts of interest that arise when industries police themselves 
 we support the highest organic standards  california organic certification standards  for example  
 we advocate shifting price supports and government subsidies to organic  regeneratively produced food products so that they will be competitive with chemically produced food 
 we believe that everyone  not just the wealthy  must be able to afford safe and healthy food 
 we urge the banning of sewage sludge or hazardous wastes as fertilizer  and of irradiation and the use of genetic engineering in all food production 
 we would phase out man made pesticides and artificial fertilizers in favor of integrated pest management techniques as part of a regenerative approach to biodiversity in the rural ecosystem 
 food prices ought to reflect the true cost of food  including the health effects of eating processed foods  antibiotic resistance  pesticide effects on growers and consumers  soil erosion  water pollution  pesticide drift  and air pollution 
 indirect costs  loss of rural communities  a heavily subsidized transportation system  cost of the military necessary to defend cheap oil  and reduced security   though more difficult to calculate  should be factored into the cost of our highly centralized food system 
 world hunger can best be addressed by food securitybeing self sufficient for basic needs 
 overpopulation is largely a consequence  not simply a cause  of poverty and environmental destruction  and all remedial actions must address living standards and food security through sustainable production 
 because of the tremendous amount of energy used in agriculture  we support farm subsidies to encourage the transition from dirty fuels to regenerative  no till practices that use clean renewable energy as one of the most effective ways to move our country to a sustainable future 
 we encourage states to promote net metering to make decentralized energy production economically viable  with subsidies to farm operations transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy 
 animal farming must be practiced in ethically and environmentally sustainable ways 
 we support a rapid phase out of confined animal feeding operations  cafos  and a complete transition to an integrated  regenerative agriculture approach to the cultivation  treatment  and use of livestock  not only for environmental reasons  but also for the sake of food safety  e 
 disease epidemics   public health  and animal protection 
 applying the precautionary principle to genetically modified organisms  gmos   we support a moratorium until safety can be demonstrated by independent  non corporate funded   long term tests for food safety  genetic drift  resistance  soil health  effects on non target organisms  and cumulative interactions 
 most importantly  we support the growing international demand to eliminate patent rights for genetic material  life forms  gene splicing techniques  and bio chemicals derived from them 
 this position is defined by the treaty to share the genetic commons  which is available through the institute for agriculture and trade policy 
 the implications of corporate takeover and the resulting monopolization of genetic intellectual property by the bioengineering industry are immense we support mandatory  full disclosure food and fiber labeling 
 a consumer has the right to know the contents in their food and fiber  how they were produced  and where they come from 
 labels should address the presence of gmos  use of irradiation  pesticide application  in production  transport  storage  and retail   whether organic standards were met  whether regenerative methods were employed in cultivation  and the country of origin 
 we support the restoration of farmlands to african american families who have been discriminated against and who have lost  or are about to lose  their farms as a result 
 greens will work for a meaningful remedy to restore african american farmers unencumbered ownership of their land 
 biological diversity humanity must share the planet with all other species 
 our continuing destruction of animal habitats threatens an ever growing number of species with extinction 
 this not only deprives these species of their existence  but will deprive future human generations of the enrichment of having these species on the earth 
 ecological systems are diverse and interlocking  and natures survival strategy can best be found in the adaptability that comes as a result of biological diversity 
 all policies concerning human settlement  food  energy  natural resources  water  coastal development  and industrialization should be formulated to prevent further disruption of the non human ecosystems ability to maintain themselves 
 the green party supports a strengthened and enforceable endangered species act 
 the convention on biological diversity  first adopted at the earth summit in       is a primary statement of purpose regarding how we can act to preserve and sustain our common genetic resources 
 to amend this unprecedented international agreement on behalf of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  with their insistence on protection of their intellectual property and technology transfer rights 
 we encourage  and support public access to  seed banks and seed collections that emphasize traditional and heirloom seeds 
 we call for widespread education on the critical importance of efforts being made to replant indigenous plant life where it has dwindled or been lost 
 we oppose monopolistic production of high tech hybrid seeds 
 this is the basis of monoculture where agribusiness relies on non sustainable methods such as single crop varieties bred with industrial traits and grown with high input of energy  chemicals  and pesticides 
 this has led to a massive loss of biodiversity  displacing traditional varieties and seed stocks 
 we encourage the use of diverse natural seed varieties passed down over many generations 
 crops can be grown with the best plants seeds being saved season to season 
 we oppose international trade agreements  nafta  gatt and the wto in particular  that have precedent setting provisions protecting transnational  corporate control of the intellectual property of genetic material  hybrid seeds  and proprietary products 
 we support reintroducing native species to areas from which they have been eradicated  eliminating predator control on public lands  and reintroducing native predators where they would contribute to a viable ecosystem 
 we should educate ourselves about animal behaviors to overcome our cultures irrational fear of wildlife  and learn techniques of co existence with other species 
 since the efforts to clone animals and eventually humanshas been undertaken by profit making corporations  the purpose behind such projects is to manufacture commodities 
 to classify a human  or any part thereof  including human dna and body organs  as a commodity is to turn human beings into property 
 support an executable and enforceable international agreement that preserves existing biodiversity  and mitigates biodiversity loss during the ongoing  th mass extinction  but also works to repair our fractured  shrinking biodiversity in order to ensure overall health of the biosphere using a framework similar to that of the montreal protocol  see chapter iii 
 ethical treatment of animals cruelty to animals is repugnant and criminal 
 the mark of a humane and civilized society lies in how we treat the least protected among us 
 to extend rights to other sentient  living beings is our responsibility and a mark of our place among all of creation 
 we call for an intelligent  compassionate approach to the treatment of animals 
 we reject the belief that our species is the center of creation  and that other life forms exist only for our use and enjoyment 
 our species does not have the right to exploit and inflict violence on other creatures simply because we have the desire and power to do so 
 our ethic upholds not only the value of biological diversity and the integrity and continuity of species  but also the value of individual lives and the interest of individual animals 
 the green party advocates humane treatment of animals with the following policies  redirect the funds that are disbursed annually by the national institutes of health away from animal experiments and more towards direct health care  preventive medicine  and biomedical research using non animal procedures such as clinical  epidemiological  and cell culture research 
 expand the animal welfare act to include rats  mice  and birds 
 phase out the use of animals for consumer product testing  tobacco and alcohol testing  psychological testing  classroom demonstrations and dissections  weapons development and other military programs 
 mandate clear labeling of products to tell whether or not they have been tested on animals and if they contain any animal products or by products 
 establish procedures to develop greater public scrutiny of all animal research 
 these should include the welfare of laboratory animals  and a halt to wasteful public funding of unnecessary research such as duplicative experiments 
 end the abuse of animals  including farm animals  and strengthen our enforcement of existing laws 
 ban the sale of exotic or endangered animals  as well as the use and sale of goods produced from them 
 prohibit large scale commercial breeding facilities  such as  puppy mills   because of the massive suffering  overpopulation  and ill health such facilities produce 
 subsidize spay and neuter clinics to combat the ever worsening pet overpopulation problem that results in the killing of millions of animals every year 
 where unwanted companion animals are being killed in shelters  we advocate mandatory spay and neuter laws 
 ban the exploitation  abuse  and neglect of animals in entertainment and sports 
 oppose captivity of cetaceans  whales  dolphins  porpoises  for entertainment and or commercial profit 
 end the capture and exploitation of cetaceans for entertainment purposes in marine parks and aquariums and captive breeding programs to maintain entertainment stock 
 support funding for the development of sanctuaries for cetaceans which may be transitional or permanent depending on the evaluation of the cetaceans involved 
 encourage a plant based diet to reduce methane gas emissions that contribute to climate change  reduce animal suffering  reduce animal waste runoff in waterways  reduce animal consumption of grain that could feed the impoverished  and for improved health  among other reasons 
 prohibit the practice of tethering domesticated animals outdoors in extreme weather  as well as leaving domesticated animals outdoors during such weather without adequate shelter 
 extreme weather includes but is not limited to below freezing temperatures  temperatures above          hurricanes  thunderstorms  and tornados 
 ban the sale  production  import  and export of foie gras and any other products that are the result of force feeding 
 ban the sale  production  import and export of animal furs 
 place an immediate ban on the practice of declawing  which is immensely harmful and traumatic surgery which involves the amputation of part of an animals limbs 
 declawing can have health determinants including painful paws  infection  and tissue death as well as behavioral issues such as aggression and or improper soiling 
 legalize and fund the practice of trap and release  tnr  of feral  domesticated animals for the purpose of spay and neutering by programs run by licensed veterinarians at any public or private animal shelter  releasing agency  hospital  or clinic 
 ban the practice of horse racing  greyhound racing  pig racing  and all other situations where animals are commercially raced 
 place an immediate ban on the use of whips in horse racing and steeplechase 
 ban the use of animals in circuses and call for their re homing to their natural habitats where possible  otherwise to conservational zoos or sanctuaries 
 require that all zoos and private collections of non domesticated animals must be for the purposes of conservation and rehabilitation or providing sanctuary for those animals unable to be released back into their natural habitat 
 guarantee that public buildings that serve food such as schools  jails and hospitals participate in the practice of  green monday  where all foods served on one day of the week does not contain animal products and byproducts to provide ethical  healthier  and climate friendly meals one day out of each week 
 forestry practices from oxygen production to water conservation to carbon sinks to stratospheric ozone regulation to medicines and homes for all kinds of creatures  forests are indispensable to human and animal life and must be protected 
 globally  the planet has already lost     of our pre colonial forests and the plant and animal communities they supported 
 our rapidly increasing numbers  high consumption rates  and profit incentives have resulted in massive forest destruction due to logging and development  and the earths remaining rain forests are being destroyed and transformed into cattle pastures or mono crops for bio fuels production 
 and elsewhere in the last few decades is alarming 
 the causes are multiple  pests  diseases  climate change  acid rain  other forms of pollution  and increased uv radiation due to our thinned ozone layer 
 in our eastern woodlands  for example  the normal pre pollution background mortality rate would be   
 that translates to the death of one tree out of     living trees each year 
 anything over a   or    mortality rate per year is considered a disaster 
 yet  we are now witnessing local tree die offs of    to     and even higher  the fact is that the pollution inherent to our industrial production and lifestyles has weakened the resistance of the interconnected ecosystems we call forests 
 malnourished due to acid rains destruction of their roots  and bombarded by unusually high uv radiation  our forests are falling victim to a host of diseases and pests 
 forestry practices such as clearcutting also destroy the mycorrhizal fungi with which trees have a symbiotic relationship  and regeneration is slowed or impossible 
 the green party calls for actions to protect our forests  overhaul state and u 
 forest service rules to protect our forests and use them wisely 
 review  reform and restructure all federal and state landuse policies so that our practices become environmentally sustainable  and so that forests provide a continuing supply of high quality wood products 
 stop building logging roads in national forests at taxpayers expense 
 these roads not only cost more than the revenue from timber sales that they expedite  but they also contribute to soil erosion and silting of streams  which ruin fish habitats 
 ban the export of raw logs and other minimally processed forest products  pulp  chips  carts  slabs  etc 
 this will maximize employment opportunities through value added processing  and promote sustainability and worker control 
 use work projects  goats  and other sustainable methods to control undergrowth rather than spraying herbicides  especially near communities 
 grow and use hemp as a plentiful and renewable resource for the manufacture of paper and other forest products 
 protect significant archaeological  historical and cultural sites 
 support the rights of people indigenous to the rainforest  and their ecologically sound use of the forest  such as rubber extraction  nut gathering  and collecting medicinal herbs 
 forgive the debts of third world countries that need help in halting the destruction of their rain forest lands 
 develop labels that identify ecologically sound forest products 
 this would help consumers to support ecologically sound forestry 
 protect wildlife habitats  fisheries  biodiversity  scenery  and recreation 
 we must accept responsibility for the affect local actions have on the global economy and ecology 
 government offices use      post consumer waste paper processed chlorine free  and that any new fiber necessary to the process come from alternative sources such as hemp or kenaf 
 where recycled paper is inappropriate  such as for archival quality paper  high quality fiber such as hemp should be the primary source 
 ban all clearcutting on publicly owned lands and in privately owned  old growth  forests  and strictly regulate clearcutting in private sector commercial forestry 
 ocean protection our position our oceans  with their enormous diversity of life and function  are essential to life on earth and must be preserved 
 our oceans are threatened by climate change  pollution  whaling  over fishing  factory fishing  bottom trawling  by catch  pirate fishing and fish farming 
 simple  strong policy changes can rejuvenate the health of our oceans and planet 
 green solutions protect     of the worlds oceans as marine preserves  especially near shore coastal habitats 
 determine protected zones through a democratic process involving all stakeholders 
 ban the siting of liquefied natural gas facilities off the u 
 phase out use of the once through cooling process  currently used by power plants  in and near coastal waters 
 require secondary treatment of waste effluent before release 
 ban ocean transportation of nuclear and toxic waste 
 support the ban on international commercial whaling as well as other international efforts to protect endangered marine species 
 ban drift net fishing and long line fishing as these methods entangle whales and other sea life 
 phase out factory trawling which decimates coral reefs and other oceanic ecosystems 
 ban the importation of fish and fish products from countries that use drift nets and other illegal means 
 map undersea toxic dump sites  and investigate methods of rendering them harmless 
 ban the importation of coral products and the destruction of breakwaters 
 support the law of the sea treaty that establishes the global sharing of ocean resources 
 support complete cleanup of existing and past oil spills 
 cost of cleanups and compensation for affected communities should be paid by the corporations responsible for the spills 
 support an international agreement for the full cleanup of all plastic waste currently in our oceans  with a focus on heavily polluted international waters and environmentally sensitive ecosystems in areas like the great pacific garbage patch and the great barrier reef 
 require ropeless fishing gear when taking any species of fish for commercial or recreational purposes in any trap fishery  including  but not limited to  dungeness crab  spiny lobster  and spot prawn 
 ban the practice of fish farming as these methods require vast amounts of antibiotics  which if leached into nearby waterways pose a danger to the health and well being of wildlife and humans 
 international environmental policy gpus believes that an international agreement should be reached which sets     an executable and enforceable framework for keeping earth well within its   measurable planetary boundaries  currently including climate change  biosphere integrity  land system change  freshwater use  biogeochemical flows  ocean acidification  and stratospheric ozone depletion      an executable and enforceable framework for the designation of at least     of the planet as a nature reserve and     international protections  funding  and legal personhood to large swaths of wildlands like the brazilian amazon and nile river  including rivers longer than       km and wildlands larger than           acres 
 gpus supports the addition of the crime of ecocide to the rome statute which created and empowers the international criminal court 
 the definition drafted by a team of lawyers commissioned by the stop ecocide foundation should be taken as a starting point  with refinements added to hold corporations and governments accountable for ecocide committed by their individual agents 
 gpus calls on the us and the international community to adopt and enforce strong language on defining ecocide  and vigorous and comprehensive enforcement of that language 
 rights of nature we support the adoption of local  state  and federal laws which recognize the legal rights of natural communities and ecosystems including wetlands  streams  rivers  aquifers  and other water systems to exist  flourish  regenerate  naturally evolve  and be restored 
 we support the inclusion in those laws of the ability of people and communities to file legal actions in the name of the affected natural community or ecosystem  and for courts to require restoration of the natural community or ecosystem back to its pre damaged state 
 greens recognize that human  animal  and plant life on this planet are not separate from nature 
 functional harm to nature from endocrine disrupting chemicals  edcs  must be reduced in the environment 
 because edcs have toxic effects on the ability of natural systems to heal and regenerate themselves  with subsequent negative impacts on biodiversity  these chemicals must be reduced and ultimately eliminated  
 the rights of natural systems to be free from harm by edcs is in the best interest of present and future generations of human  animal  plant and systemic biomes in all soil  wetlands  freshwater and saltwater environments necessary to sustain life 
 a responsible use policy for necessary edc pharmaceuticals and chemotherapy waste as well as certain fire retardants should be implemented as well to protect the larger biosphere 
 climate change do you like this page  tweet we support local production  local manufacturing  local sales  local recycling wherever and whenever possible 
 we encourage face to face relationships with local business owners and shopkeepers  
 green economics is rooted in ecological economics 
 our economy should reflect and respect the diverse  delicate ecosystems of our planet 
 it is unjust and unsustainable because it is premised on endless economic growth and destruction of nature 
 our market economy  by externalizing the environmental and social costs of greenhouse gas emissions  is creating the greatest market failure in history  climate change  and its devastating effects 
 our governments top economic goal increasing gross domestic product impels us to perpetually intensify our resource use and environmental destruction 
 green economic policy places value not just on material wealth  but on the things which truly make life worth living our health  our relationships  our communities  our environment  and building peace and justice throughout our nation and the world 
 we aim to maximize our quality of life with a minimum of consumption 
 we propose a shift away from materialism to help people live more meaningful lives as we save the planet from climate change and ever larger mountains of waste 
 we need to acquire the ability to distinguish between need and greed 
 we must also end the colossal waste of taxpayer funds for armaments and war  to reduce our nations federal debt  and fund our environmental and social needs 
 greens intend to provide a green job to anyone who wants one 
 we support using the tax system to bring more equality to our nation 
 rising income inequality makes us all poorer in myriad ways 
 more equal societies are happier  healthier  safer and greener 
 greens support strong local economies and regional trade 
 the best model of economic security is for a community and region to be largely self sufficient in the production of its necessities 
 we support not the corporate control of  free trade  which  through the machinations of the world trade organization places the enrichment of multinational corporations above the level of national laws but  fair trade   which protects communities  labor  consumers and the environment 
 local economic vibrancy and regional trade keep more money in the community and the region  rather than going to distant corporate headquarters 
 this is the most sensible model for economic security 
 greens will change the legal design of the corporation so that it does not maximize profits at the expense of the environment  human rights  public health  workers  or the communities in which it operates 
 we believe the giant multinational corporation is the worlds most potent force for environmental and social destruction 
 unlike other political parties in the modern era  the green party views economics not as an end in itself but as a service to community development through the building and strengthening of community bonds that constitute the social fabric 
 greens are defenders of the commonsthe vast trove of wealth owned by the people  the social and tangible assets we inherit from generations past 
 most people living in this country yearn for a more vibrant and lively commons  such as a richer community life  more parks and protected wilderness  clean air and water  more silence  better access to information and knowledge  and a more nourishing culture 
 we must stop big business from undermining and stealing our common wealth  such as our public forests and minerals  the fruits of federal research  the public airwaves and the internet 
 ecological economics to create an enduring society we must devise a system of production and commerce where every act is sustainable and restorable 
 we believe that all business has a social contract with society and the environment in effect a fiduciary responsibility and that the concepts of socially responsible business and shareholder democracy can be models for prospering  successful business 
 we call for an economic system that is based on a combination of private businesses  decentralized democratic cooperatives  publicly owned enterprises  and alternative economic structures 
 collectively  this system puts human and ecological needs alongside profits to measure success  and maintains accountability to communities 
 community based economics constitutes an alternative to both corporate capitalism and state socialism 
 the drive to accumulate power and wealth is a pernicious characteristic of a civilization headed in a pathological direction 
 greens advocate that economic relations become more direct  more cooperative  and more egalitarian 
 humanizing economic relations is just one aspect of our broader objective  to shift toward a different way of life characterized by sustainability  regionalization  more harmonious balance between the natural ecosphere and the human made technosphere  and revival of community life 
 our perspective is antithetical to both big business and big government 
 true cost pricing   we support production methods that eliminate waste 
 in natural systems  everything is a meal for something else 
 we need to mimic natural systems in the way we manufacture and produce things 
 consumables need to be designed to be thrown into a compost heap and or eaten 
 durable goods would be designed in closed loop systems  ultimately to be disassembled and reassembled 
 toxics would be safeguarded  minimally produced  secured  and would ideally have markers identifying them in perpetuity with their makers 
 the green party opposes capitalism and seeks to build an alternative economic system based on social ecology  decentralization of power  and freedom from state control 
 we will build an eco socialist economy based on large scale green public works  municipalization  and workplace and community democracy 
 worker and community empowerment will ensure that decisions that greatly affect our lives are made in the interests of our communities  not at the whim of capitalist ceos and distant boards of directors 
 democratically run enterprises embedded in and accountable to our communities will make more ecologically sound decisions and help end labor exploitation  environmental exploitation  and racial  gender  and wealth inequality and bring about economic and social justice 
 greens view the economy as a part of the ecosystem  not as an isolated subset in which nothing but resources come in and products and waste go out 
 there is a fundamental conflict between economic growth and environmental protection 
 there is an absolute limit to economic growth based on laws of thermodynamics and principles of ecology 
 long before that limit is reached  an optimum size of the economy is reached which maximizes human welfare in an holistic sense 
 we support a superfund for workers program as envisioned by the oil  chemical and atomic workers union in      
 such a program would guarantee full income and benefits for all workers displaced by ecological conversion until they find new jobs with comparable income and benefits 
 the green party supports methods  such as the index of social health indicators  the index of sustainable economic welfare  and the genuine progress indicator  that take into account statistics on housing  income  and nutrition 
 measuring economic health economic growth has been a primary goal of u 
 corporations  politicians beholden to corporations  and economists funded by corporations advocate a theory of unlimited economic growth stemming from technological progress 
 based upon established principles of the physical and biological sciences  however  there is a limit to economic growth 
 this policy of securing economic growth is having negative effects on the long term ecological and economic welfare of the united states and the world 
 there is a fundamental conflict between economic growth and ecological health  for example  biodiversity conservation  clean air and water  atmospheric stability  
 we cannot rely on technological progress to solve ecological and long term economic problems 
 rather  we should endeavor to make lifestyle choices that reinforce a general equilibrium of humans with nature 
 this requires consciously choosing to foster environmentally sound technologies  whether they are newer or older technologies  rather than technologies conducive to conspicuous consumption and waste 
 economic growth  as gauged by increasing gross domestic product  gdp   is a dangerous and anachronistic goal 
 the most viable and sustainable alternative is a steady state economy 
 a steady state economy has a stable or mildly fluctuating product of population and per capita consumption  and is generally indicated by stable or mildly fluctuating gdp 
 the steady state economy has become a more appropriate goal than economic growth in the united states and other large  wealthy economies 
 a steady state economy precludes ever expanding production and consumption of goods and services 
 however  a steady state economy does not preclude economic developmenta qualitative process not gauged by gdp growth and other measures that overlook ecological effects 
 one way to measure the economy is to assess the value of non monetary goods and services and measure the rate of infant mortality  life expectancy of people  educational opportunities offered by the state  family stability  environmental data  and health care for all people 
 another measure is to quantify human benefit  in terms of education  health care  elder care  etc 
 measuring the gap between the most fortunate and the least fortunate in our society  for example  tells us how well or poorly we are doing in creating an economy that does not benefit some at the expense of others 
 for many nations with widespread poverty  increasing per capita consumption  through economic growth or through more equitable distributions of wealth  remains an appropriate goal 
 ultimately  however  the global ecosystem will not be able to support further economic growth 
 therefore  an equitable distribution of wealth among nations is required to maintain a global steady state economy 
 a global economy with inequitable wealth distribution will be subject to continual international strife and conflict 
 such strife and conflict  in turn  ensures the economic unsustainability of some nations and threatens the economic sustainability of all 
 curbing corporate power our position greens want to reduce the economic and political power of large corporations  end corporate personhood and re design corporations to serve our society  democracy and the environment 
 unelected and unaccountable corporate executives are not merely exercising power in our society they are ruling us 
 greens will reduce corporate powers and privileges  including by stripping them of artificial  personhood  and constitutional protections 
 the green party supports strong and effectively enforced antitrust laws and regulation to counteract the concentration of economic and political power that imposes a severe toll on people  places and the planet 
 greens believe the legal structure of the corporation is obsolete 
 at present  corporations are designed solely to generate profit 
 this legal imperative profit above all else is damaging our country and our planet in countless ways 
 we must change the legal design of corporations so that they generate profits  but not at the expense of the environment  human rights  public health  workers  or the communities in which the corporation operates 
 one point remains unequivocal  our planet cannot afford business as usual any longer 
 because corporations have become the dominant economic institution of the planet  we must compel them to serve human and environmental needs  so that our peoples  nations and environment may live long and prosper 
 a key first step will be federal and state constitutional amendments abolishing the legal fiction of corporate personhood 
 federal chartering of corporations that includes comprehensive  strict and enforceable social responsibility requirements 
 strengthen the civil justice system to ensure that it holds corporations strictly liable for corporate crime  fraud  violence and malfeasance 
 this would include revoking the charters of corporations that routinely violate safety  health  environmental protection or other laws 
 empower shareholders to stop abuses by the managers they hire through a structure of democratic governance and elections 
 enforce existing antitrust laws and support even tougher new ones to curtail the overwhelming economic and political power of large corporations 
 increase funding for and strengthen oversight of federal antitrust enforcement 
 livable income we affirm the importance of access to a livable income 
 we call for a universal basic income  sometimes called a guaranteed income  negative income tax  citizens income  or citizen dividend  
 this would go to every adult regardless of health  employment  or marital status  in order to minimize government bureaucracy and intrusiveness into peoples lives 
 the amount should be sufficient so that anyone who is unemployed can afford basic food and shelter 
 state or local governments should supplement that amount from local revenues where the cost of living is high 
 job banks and other innovative training and employment programs which bring together the private and public sectors must become federal  state and local priorities 
 people who are unable to find decent work in the private sector should have options through publicly funded opportunities 
 workforce development programs must aim at moving people out of poverty 
 the growing inequities in income and wealth between rich and poor  unprecedented discrepancies in salary and benefits between corporate top executives and line workers  loss of the  american dream  by the young and middle classeach is a symptom of decisions made by policy makers far removed from the concerns of ordinary workers trying to keep up 
 a clear living wage standard should serve as a foundation for trade between nations  and a  floor  of guaranteed wage protections and workers rights should be negotiated in future trade agreements 
 the united states should take the lead on this front and not allow destructive  predatory corporate practices under the guise of  free  international trade 
 fair taxation our position federal and state taxes must be strongly progressive 
 it is riddled with loopholes  subsidies and dodges for corporations and the super rich 
 most working people pay too much in taxes compared to corporations  multi millionaires and billionaires 
 many of our biggest and most profitable corporations pay little or no tax 
 much investment income is taxed at less than the rate workers pay 
 we can afford to cut taxes for most people if we make corporations and the super rich pay their fair share 
 then we can cut them even more when we halt our nations wasteful spending on wars  weaponry and militarism 
 we call for progressive taxation  shifting tax from individuals to corporations  taxing  bads  not  goods   taxing unearned income at the same rate as earned income  taxing speculation on wall street  and cutting corporate tax giveaways 
 we will institute comprehensive tax reform to simplify the tax system 
 we will eliminate loopholes and other exemptions that favor corporate and wealthy interests over tax justice 
 small business  in particular  should not be penalized by a tax system which benefits those who can  work  the legislative tax committees for breaks and subsidies 
 we support substantive and wide ranging re  form of the tax system that helps create jobs  economic efficiencies and innovation within the small business community 
 greens believe government should have a tax policy which encourages small and socially responsible business 
 political democracy remains a distant promise without economic democracy 
 a principal instrument for achieving economic democracy is our tax system 
 taxes are the means whereby we fund our public services 
 they can also help create equity  justice  health and sustainability 
 green solutions cut taxes for wage workers exempt people earning less than         per year and families earning less than         per year  adjusted for inflation  from the federal and state income taxes 
 exempt food  clothing  prescription medications  other necessities and second hand goods from sales taxes 
 fair taxes for corporations and the wealthy end corporate welfare  such as the bailouts for wall street  the big banks and the automobile industry  subsidies for agribusiness  export import bank loan guarantees  tax abatements for big box stores  the tax loophole for  carried interest  from private equity and hedge fund managers  tax deductibility for advertising and business entertainment  offshore tax avoidance schemes  giveaways for new sports stadiums and casinos 
 impose a financial transaction tax on trades of stocks  bonds  currency  derivatives  and other financial instruments 
 block financial transactions with tax havens  to stop tax evasion 
 decrease the    million home value cap on the mortgage interest tax deduction for federal income taxes  to reduce the tax subsidy provided to those living in the most expensive homes 
 apply the federal insurance contributions act  social security and medicare  taxes to investment income and to all levels of income  not merely the first          earned 
   per year on an individuals assets over    million 
 eco taxes to help save the planet establish a system of carbon taxes on all fossil fuels  to begin to reflect the real environmental cost of their extraction and use 
 carbon taxes should be applied as far upstream as possible  preferably when possession of the carbon bearing fuel passes from extraction  for ex  ample  coal mine  oil wellhead or tanker  gas wellhead  to the next entity in the supply chain  for example  coal shipper or utility  oil refiner or importer  natural gas pipeline  
 offset potential regressivity for lower income individuals via the green tax shift that lowers income taxes and or other approaches 
 eliminate tax subsidies for the oil  gas  coal  nuclear and timber and mining industries 
 enact a green tax shift that shifts from taxing people and work  via income and payroll taxes  to taxing natural resource extraction  use  waste and pollution 
 enact a system of community ground rent land value taxation that distinguishes between the socially and privately created wealth of land  by increasing the taxes on the former to retain for society the value that it collectively creates and lowers them on the latter to reward individuals for their initiative and work 
 to ensure that prices reflect their true environmental cost  enact a system of true cost pricing  tcp  for goods and services 
 tcp is an accounting and pricing system that includes all costs in the price of a product 
 tcp charges extractive and productive industries for the immediate or prolonged damage  pollution of air and water  and diminishment of natural resources caused by their acts 
 impose a carbon fee on goods imported from nations with lower carbon taxes than in the u 
  based upon the carbon spent in manufacturing and transporting them to the u 
 make it transparent  understand  able and resistant to the machinations of powerful corporate and wealthy interests 
 raise taxes on tobacco  alcohol  soda pop and other junk food 
 local economic development our position greens support reforms that give communities more control over their own local economies 
 greens support decentralization  and call for a community based economics whose aim is local prosperity and self sufficiency 
 we support local production  local manufacturing  local sales  local recycling wherever and whenever possible 
 we encourage face to face relationships with local business owners and shopkeepers 
 successful local green communities nurture everyone of all ages  generate good jobs and housing  and provide public services  creating cities and towns that educate everyone  encourage recreation  and preserve natural and cultural resources  building local governments that protect people from environmental hazards and crime  and motivating citizens to participate in making decisions 
 green solutions protect local businesses from the predatory pricing practices of chain and  big box  stores 
 support incentives for co operative enterprises  such as consumer co ops  workers co operatives  credit unions and other institutions that help communities develop economic projects 
 allow municipalities to approve or disapprove large economic projects case by case based on environmental impacts  local ownership  community reinvestment  wage levels  and working conditions 
 allow communities to set environmental  consumer  human rights  labor  health and safety standards higher than federal or state minimums 
 invest in the commons  rebuild infrastructure  improve mass transit  protect and restore the environment 
 establish local currencies such as time dollars  ithaca hours and berkshares  to strengthen local economies 
 enact corporate  good character  laws  requiring corporations  when applying for a permit  to disclose all violations of law they have committed 
 empower officials to deny permits based on such information 
 small business and the self employed greens support a program that counteracts concentration and abuse of economic power 
 we support many different initiatives for forming successful  small enterprises that together can become an engine of  and sustainable model for  job creation  prosperity and progress 
 small businesses are where the jobs are being created 
 over the past decade and a half  all new net job growth has come from the small business sector 
 the green economic model is about true prosperitygreen means prosperity 
 our goal is to go beyond the dedicated good work being done by many companies  referred to as  socially responsible business   and to present new ways of seeing how business can help create a sustainable world  while surviving in a competitive business climate 
 we believe that conservation should be profitable  and employment should be creative  meaningful and fairly compensated 
 access to capital is often an essential need in growing a business 
 banking and insurance reform in this chapter   the present tax system acts to discourage small business as it encourages waste  discourages conservation  and rewards consumption 
 big business has used insider access to dominate the federal tax code 
 the tax system needs a major overhaul to favor the legitimate and critical needs of the small business community 
 retention of capital through retained earnings  efficiencies  and savings is central to small business competitiveness 
 current tax policies often act to unfairly penalize small business 
 government should reduce unnecessary restrictions  fees  and bureaucracy 
 in particular  the paper simplification act should be seen as a way to benefit small business  and it should be improved in response to the needs of small businesses and the self employed 
 health insurance premiums paid by the self employed should be fully deductible 
 state and local government should encourage businesses that benefit the community especially 
 economic development initiatives should include citizen and community input 
 the type and size of businesses that are given incentives  tax  loans  bonds  etc 
  should be the result of local community participation 
 pension funds  the result of workers investments  should be examined as additional sources of capital for small business 
 pension reform in this chapter   insurance costs should be brought down by means of active engagement with the insurance industry 
 one stop offices should be established by government to assist individuals who want to change careers or go into business for the first time 
 home based and neighborhood based businesses should be assisted by forward looking planning  not hurt by out of date zoning ordinances 
 telecommuting and home offices should be aided  not hindered  by government 
 work and job creation there is plenty of work to do that does not jeopardize our future  does not widen the gap between the richest and the poorest in our society  and that can enrich our communities 
 we must encourage the creation of these opportunities 
 people whose livelihoods depend on supporting remote  multi national corporations cannot be expected to support changing the system 
 the green party proposes a third alternative to a job or no job dichotomy  that is to provide everyone a sustainable livelihood 
 the need of our times is for security  not necessarily jobs 
 we need security in the knowledge that  while markets may fluctuate and jobs may come and go  we are still able to lead a life rooted in dignity and well being 
 the concept of a  job  is only a few hundred years old  and the artificial dichotomy between  employment  and  unemployment  has become a tool of social leverage for corporate exploiters 
 this produces a dysfunctional society in various ways      it is used to justify bringing harmful industries to rural communities  such as extensive prison construction and clear cutting of pristine forests 
     it has been used to pit workers  people needing jobs  against the interests of their own communities 
     it has created a self esteem crisis in a large segment of the adult population who have been forced into doing work that is irrelevant  socially harmful  or environmentally unsound 
 we will also promote policies that have job increasing effects 
 many people will still need jobs for their security 
 we need to counterbalance the decline in jobs caused either by new technology  corporate flight to cheaper labor markets outside our borders  or the disappearance of socially wasteful jobs that will inevitably occur as more and more people embrace a green culture 
 to begin a transition to a system providing sustainable livelihood  we support  creating alternative  low consumption communities and living arrangements  including a reinvigorated sustainable homesteading movement in rural areas and voluntary shared housing in urban areas 
 universal health care requiring coverage for all 
 health care in chapter ii   the creating and spreading local currencies and barter systems 
 subsidizing technological development of consumer items that would contribute toward economic autonomy  such as renewable energy devices 
 establishing local non profit development corporations 
 providing people with information about alternatives to jobs 
 creating jobs for creating jobs we propose  reducing taxes on labor 
 this will make labor more competitive with energy and capital investment 
   see taxation above   solidarity with unions and workers fighting the practice of contracting out tasks to part time workers in order to avoid paying benefits and to break up unions 
 adopting a reduced hour        hours  work week as a standard 
 this could translate into as many as    million new jobs 
 subsidizing renewable energy sources  which directly employ   to   times as many people for every unit of electricity generated as fossil or nuclear sources yet are cost competitive 
 also  retrofit existing buildings for energy conservation and build non polluting  low impact transportation systems 
 supporting small business by reducing tax  fee and bureaucratic burdens 
 the majority of new jobs today are created by small businesses 
 this would cut their failure rate and help them create more jobs 
 opposing the trend toward  bundling  of contracts that minimizes opportunity for small  minority owned  and women owned businesses 
 reducing consumption to minimize outsourcing the exportation of jobs to other countriesthus reducing the relative price of using u 
 banking and insurance reform our position greens will overhaul the financial industries to end their culture of impunity and to prevent them from committing fraud or malfeasance so severe as to drive our nation into a massive recession or depression 
 since finance  banking  and insurance institutions occupy a privileged position of power at the center of commerce  this special advantage brings with it special social responsibilities 
 we must ensure that the institutions chartered for these roles take that responsibility seriously and serve the public interest 
 greens aim to reform the financial industries to eliminate usury  exorbitantly high interest rates on loans  and ensure that they meet their obligations to taxpayers and local communities 
 green solutions banking reform break up our nations largest banks and financial institutions so that none is  too big to fail 
  end taxpayer  funded bailouts for banks  insurers and other financial companies 
 regulate all financial derivatives  ban any predatory or gambling use of derivatives  and require full transparency for all derivative trades  to control risk of systemic financial collapse 
 require regulatory pre approval of exotic financial instruments 
 re enact the glass steagall act  which prohibited bank holding companies from owning other financial companies and engaging in risky economic transactions 
 oppose the federal government being the final guarantor of speculative investments 
 during a financial crisis  if the federal government and or a central bank must provide relief  it should be given in an equal manner and at the most local level possible  so that benefits are equitably dispersed and burdens are equitably borne 
 so rather than pouring trillions of dollars into the banking system  they should have provided direct mortgage relief to homeowners suffering the most from the housing bubble and negotiated with lenders to provide partial loan forgiveness 
 ensure that low  and middle income people have access to banking services  affordable loans  and small business supporting capital  especially through credit unions 
 oppose disinvestment practices  in which lending and financial institutions move money deposited in local communities out of those same communities  damaging the best interests of their customers and community 
 support the extension of the community reinvestment act to provide public and timely information on the extent of housing loans  small business loans to minority owned enterprises  investments in community development projects  and affordable housing 
 strengthen disclosure laws  anti redlining laws  and openness on the part of lenders regarding what criteria they use in making lending decisions 
 oppose arbitrary or discriminatory practices that deny individuals or small business access to credit 
 support development of charter community development banks  which would be capitalized with public funds and work to meet the credit needs of local communities 
 support the expansion of co operative credit unions 
 prosecute all financial fraud committed by criminal bankers 
 the green party calls for the aggressive investigation and prosecution of both individuals and corporate entities that engage in these criminal acts 
 present laws shield corporate officers and employees from prosecution 
 existing fines resulting from convictions against corporate entities do not provide an adequate deterrent to their abuse of power 
 penalties for crimes against ordinary consumers should include prison terms for executives and employees  as well as fines  revocations of charters and confiscation of corporate and individual assets 
 home ownership represents the primary method by which many individuals accumulate wealth 
 if lending institutions are found to have engaged in fraudulent lending or foreclosure practices  then judicial remedies should include fines and imprisonment  as well as equitable remedies in the form of damages  refinancing  and debt forgiveness for homeowners 
 laws should be strengthened to protect consumers against foreclosure on their homes by banks and other lending agencies 
 strict laws should be enacted that provide swift criminal prosecution of any lending agency  including executives  employees  lawyers and other firms that assist them in fraudulent practices and fraudulent foreclosures 
 laws should also be enacted to provide individual homeowners with legal assistance through publicly funded agencies when faced with any potential financial fraud  including foreclosure 
 access to primary  secondary  post secondary and vocational education should be a right of all  not a privilege of the wealthy  and certainly not an opportunity for predatory lenders 
 its time to forgive all student and parent loans taken out to finance post secondary and vocational education 
 the estimated     billion is a fraction of the bailout distributed among the predatory lenders who created the student debt crisis and would make a material difference for households across the country 
 public banking   we support public banking consistent with the greening the dollar plank   that is  that the power to create money no longer resides with banks  private or public 
 we support the expansion of state and municipal public banking based on the model of the bank of north dakota  which does not create money when it lends  but lends only funds already deposited with the bank 
 insurance reform clean up the insurance industry 
 eliminate special interest protections  collusion  over pricing and industry wide practices that too often injure the interests of the insured when they are most vulnerable 
 prohibit bad faith insurance practices  such as avoidance of obligations and price fixing 
 until single payer is established  we support laws that act to make insurance policies transportable from job to job 
 support and encourage the insurance industrys efforts for  loss prevention   that is  to reduce the incidence of death  injuries  disease and other calamities 
 support initiatives in secondary insurance markets that expand credit for economic development in inner cities  affordable housing and home ownership among the poor  sustainable agriculture and rural development maintaining family farms 
 prohibit companies from being the beneficiary of insurance on their own employees 
 broader financial industry reforms support a     cap on interest rates  above inflation  for credit cards  mortgages  payday loans and all other consumer lending 
 aggressively crack down on crime  fraud  malfeasance and tax evasion in the financial and insurance industries 
 support the formation of citizens utility boards to defend the interests of consumers and policyholders 
 favor a tax on stock  bond  foreign currency and derivatives transactions to discourage excessive speculation 
 pension reform working peoplewho own over    trillion in pension monies  deferred wages in effect should have financial options in where their money is invested apart from the current near monopoly exerted by a handful of managers  banks  insurance companies  and mutual funds 
 pension funds should not be used for corporate mergers  acquisitions and leveraged buyouts  corporate decisions that undercut workers rights  employment  and retirement while generously rewarding non productive speculation 
 the current system has allowed vast amounts of workers hard earned money to be squandered on job ending  plant moving  corporate downsizing 
 pension funds are gigantic capital pools that can  with government support  be used to meet community needs and benefit workers and their families directly 
 corporate sponsored pension funds  the biggest category of funds  should be jointly controlled by management and workers  not exclusively by management 
 federal law must be changed so that pension funds need simply to seek a reasonable rate of return  not the prevailing market rate which greatly restricts where investments can be made 
 a secondary pension market established by the government to insure pension investments made in socially beneficial programs must be considered as one method that could greatly expand the impact of this capital market  as demonstrated in the case of federally insured  subsidized mortgage lending 
 prudent pension fund investing should both make money and do good work 
 creating jobs and supporting employment programs in public  private partnerships can become a priority as we seek to expand towards opportunities where new jobs are created small business  not transnational business 
 we believe there are myriad opportunities for a profound shift in how the savings of our workers are best put to use 
 anti trust enforcement the green party supports strong and effectively enforced anti trust regulation to counteract the concentration of economic power that imposes a severe toll on the economy 
 the anti trust division of the justice department has had its scope and powers reduced 
 an explosion of unregulated mergers and acquisitions  spinoffs  and leveraged buy outs has overwhelmed the federal governments capacity to provide effective oversight 
 financial and trading markets have become particularly vulnerable to insider trading 
 securities and exchange commission regulation of these markets has seriously fallen short 
 overall  what we see in unchecked market power is self serving abuse of the democratic political process  price gouging  loss of productivity and jobs  reduced competitiveness  and of predatory and monopolistic practices 
 the federal trade commission must vigorously oversee mergers where the combined sales of the companies exceeds    billion 
 the justice department must redefine relevant market share  in assessing mergers 
 the congress must enact its calls for competitiveness by stopping illegal monopolistic practices 
 we oppose the largesse of government in the form of massive corporate entitlements 
 advanced technology and defense conversion the green party supports defense technology transfer towards a peacetime technology based economy  particularly new industrial applications and developments in the areas of advanced communications  alternative energy  non toxic battery technology and waste management 
 consolidation of the nuclear weapons complex should move toward alternative civilian technologies and non proliferation work  not toward a new generation of nuclear weapon design and production 
 we recognize the need for de escalating the continuing arms race  and we strongly oppose putting nuclear weapons  lasers and other weapons in space in a new militarization policy that is in clear violation of international law 
 demilitarization and exploration of space in chapter i   let us go forward with government and civilian space programs  research initiatives in sustainability science  environmental protection  ecological economics and transportation  appropriate technologies and technology transfer  environmental sampling and monitoring  systems testing  laser communications  and high speed computers 
 let us devote a larger percentage of our nations research and development budget  both private and public  toward civilian use and away from military use 
 let us address our chronic trade imbalance in this fashionnot by increasing exports of military weapons and technologies 
 the green party opposes patenting or copyrighting life forms  algorithms  dna  colors or commonly used words and phrases 
 we support broad interpretation and ultimate expansion of the fair use of copyrighted works 
 we support open source and copyleft models in order to promote the public interest and the spirit of copyright 
 we call for a federal technology assessment office to examine how technology fits with life on earth  with our neighborhoods  and with the quality of our daily lives 
 telecommunications advanced telecommunications technologies  many of which came originally from defense applications   such as fiber optics  broadband infrastructure  the internet  and the world wide web hold great promise for education  decentralized economies  and local control of decision  making 
 we believe we must move toward decentralization in these efforts  carefully protecting our individual rights as we go forward 
 advanced and high definition tv  digital communications  and wireless communications hold promise and challenge 
 for example  the public airwaves that will accommodate the new generation of telecommunications technology should not be free giveaways to media giants 
 an auction and built in requirements that attach licenses to act in the public interest is needed 
 technology provides tools  we must use these tools appropriately and ethically 
 free speech and media reform in chapter ii   broadband internet access should be open to bidding  not simply the current choice between cable or telephone company monopolies  where grassroots internet service providers must merge or go out of business 
 broad  band access should be a taxpayer funded utility  like water and sewer  ending the  digital divide  that keeps low income folks from access to the internet 
 the internet is a commons  developed with public funds  and must insure freedom and equality of access 
 the green party opposes internet access tiered service controlled by an internet service provider  isp   with independent  not housed with the isp  most costly and inaccessible 
 isps and advertisers should not be gate  keepers 
 the green party calls for increased protection for user privacy and for accountability on the part of isps 
 open source software open source software is necessary to achieve personal  cultural  and organizational security in the face of technological threats brought by corporations and individual criminals 
 government has a vital role in breaking up software monopolies  not so much by filing antitrust suits  but by buying nothing but open systems 
 government and the larger states are buyers large enough to influence the computer and software systems through their purchasing 
 it should be illegal for a government agency to create and store information vital to its operations in a format it doesnt control 
 governments should always consider storing information with open source software and in house staff instead of only commercial systems  vendors and software 
 one way to achieve this would be to add a virtual bid for in house open source deployment whenever a software purchase goes out for bid 
 the green party supports protection of software  free or proprietary  by means of the copyright 
 mathematical algorithms are discovered  not invented  by humans  therefore  they are not patentable 
 the overwhelming majority of software patents cover algorithms  and should never have been awarded  or they cover message formats of some kind  which are essentially arbitrary 
 format patents only exist to restrain competition  and the harm falls disproportionately on programmers who work independently or for the smallest employers 
 nanotechnology nanotechnologythe science of manipulating matter at the molecular levelis poised to provide a new industrial revolution with vast social and environmental consequences 
 like nuclear science and biotechnology  nanotechnology is being pursued largely outside of public debate  risking great harm and abuse in its use and application 
 the green party calls for a halt to nanotechnology development until the following conditions are met  development of full and open public debate about the implications of nanotechnology and the fusion of nanotech with biological  materials and information sciences 
 development of democratic public control mechanisms to regulate the direction of nanotechnology research and development 
 expanded research into the environmental and health consequences of exposure to nano scale materials 
 development of technology to contain and monitor nano scale materials 
 development of precautionary safety measures for the containment and control over nano scale materials 
 m  national debt fairness for our children and grandchildren our position greens will reduce our national debt 
 our nation is in debt because our privatized federal reserve monetary system only creates and issues money as debt through loans 
 the government must constantly borrow more money due to the shortfall in tax revenue  thus steadily increasing the national debt 
 our national debt has grown by trillions of dollars to finance tax cuts for americas wealthiest citizens  war  corporate welfare and bailouts of wall street and the automotive industry 
 the burden of the increasing annual interest payments on the debt falls disproportionately on working people and the small business community 
 green solutions reduce our national debt by increasing taxes on large corporations and polluters  eliminating loopholes for the super rich and decreasing expenditures in some areas  especially for war  armaments and corporate welfare 
 pay off the national debt as it comes due when greening the dollar is implemented 
 monetary reform  greening the dollar  a green public money future the crisis in our financial system makes it imperative that we restructure our monetary system 
 the present system of privatized money issuance and control has resulted in the misdirection of our financial resources to speculation  toxic financial instruments  and loans that create huge profits and wealth for the corporate few  but inadequate income and jobs for the common people 
 it is both possible and necessary for congress to take back its exclusive constitutional power to create our money  article  section    without the creation of debt  and assume the responsibility to spend this money directly into circulation to fund public benefits outlined in the federal budget 
 only with a public money system can the government direct our national wealth to the needs of the people through their local and state governments 
 a public money system will enable millions of good livelihoods  provide sufficient incomes  shrink the debt burden and begin to close the wealth gap 
 public money has not been issued since greenbacks  introduced by president lincoln in       and circulating as public money until      
 to reverse the private control of issuing our nations money  to reverse the immoral and undeserved concentration of national wealth and income resulting from that private control  to place control over money within a more equitable public system of governmental checks and balances  and to end the regular recurrence of severe and disruptive financial crises that mark the booms and busts cycles of capitalism the green party proposes the following three public money solutions to be enacted together  nationalize the    federal reserve banks and transfer administrative functions of the federal reserve board of governors to a bureau of the u 
 all money created under the nationalized federal reserve system will be treated as publicly issued money 
 the private creation of money will cease and with it the reckless practices that have led to recurring economic crises 
 all new money will be issued as a debt free  permanently circulating asset by the federal government 
 a new public monetary authority will be established under the department of treasury to scientifically determine the amount of money that can be safely created for the national economy to avoid inflation or deflation 
 the monetary authority will be empowered with full autonomy and independence to avoid political influence 
 although banks will continue as financial intermediaries  lending publicly issued money at interest  and performing traditional banking functions they will no longer be allowed to create money  ending what is known as fractional reserve banking 
 specific guidance for a progressive publicly controlled monetary authority can be found in a bill already entered into the u 
         th congress  national emergency employment defense act of       need act  
 all new money will be spent into circulation by the u 
 government as authorized by congress for public purpose 
 this includes funding a   st century infrastructure including education and health care 
 per capita spending guidelines for new money will assure a fair distribution across the nation  creating good livelihoods  re invigorating local economies and funding government at all levels 
 newly created money will also be distributed directly to state and local governments

 children are increasingly shaped by an  electronic childhood  with little direct experience of nature and free play 
 our families are scattered  our popular culture is crassly manipulated by the profit motives of increasingly concentrated media conglomerates  and our sense of community is a pale shadow of what earlier generations of americans knew 
 the green party strongly believes that quality of life is determined not only by material aspects that can be measured and counted  but also by elements that cannot be quantified 
 we firmly support the separation of church and state  but we also acknowledge the spiritual dimension of life  and we honor the cultivation of various types of spiritual experience in our diverse society 
 we believe that artistic expression and a thriving structure of art institutions are key to community well being 
 we believe that a deep and broad embrace of nonviolence is the only effective way to stop cycles of violence  from the home to the streets to the international level 
 we advocate a diverse system of education that would introduce children early to the wonders of the great school  nature   and would cultivate the wisdom of eco education  eco economics  eco politics  and eco culture 
 we seek to protect our children from the corrosive effects of mass culture that trains them to regard themselves first and foremost as consumers 
 we support the shift in modern medicine to include healing through complementary therapies and engagement with the great hospital  nature  
 we seek  in short  to facilitate the healthy unfolding of the person within the unfolding story of the family  community  bioregion  state  nation  and earth community 
 civil rights and equal rights the foundation of any democratic society is the guarantee that each member of society has equal rights 
 respect for our constitutionally protected rights is our best defense against discrimination and the abuse of power 
 also  we recognize an intimate connection between our rights as individuals and our responsibilities to our neighbors and the planet 
 the green party shall strive to secure universal and effective recognition and observance of the principles and spirit expressed in the united national universal declaration of human rights as an international standard that all nations must meet 
 we are committed to establishing relationships that honor diversity  that support the self definition and self determination of all people  that consciously confront the barriers of racism  sexism  homophobia  biphobia  transphobia  class oppression  ageism  and ableism  and the many ways that our culture and laws separate us from working together 
 we support affirmative action to remedy discrimination  to protect constitutional rights  and to provide equal opportunity under the law 
 womens rights since the beginning of what we call civilization  when mens dominance over women was firmly established  until the present day  our history has been marred with oppression of and brutality to women 
 the green party deplores this system of male domination  known as patriarchy  in all its forms  both subtle and overt from oppression  inequality  and discrimination to all forms of violence against women and girls including rape  trafficking  forced sex which is also rape  slavery  prostitution and violence against women within marriage and relationships and in all institutions 
 the change the world is crying for cannot occur unless womens voices are heard 
 democracy cannot work without equality for women  which provides equal participation and representation 
 it took an extraordinary and ongoing fight of over    years for women to win the right to vote 
 however  the equal rights amendment  first introduced in       has still not been ratified as of today  representing a continuous struggle of over     years with no victory in sight 
 we believe that equality should be a given  and that all greens must work toward that end 
 we are committed to increasing participation of women in politics  government and leadership so they can change laws  make decisions  and create policy solutions that affect and will improve womens lives 
 in july      the national womens caucus of the green party of the united states was founded to ensure that the party continues to build and elect greens to office who will honor that commitment to women 
 we also support  and call on others to support  the many existing and ongoing efforts for women  social equality we support the equal application of the constitution of the united states of america to all citizens  and therefore call for passage of the equal rights amendment  era  
 we urge accelerated ratification by three or more of the remaining states that are required to pass the era into law and into the constitution 
 we urge renewed efforts and campaigns to ratify the era 
 we support the equal rights amendment reintroduced in the u 
 congress  and support using the precedent of a three state strategy for ratification 
 we call for equal representation of women in congress  which has not yet been achieved 
 passage of cedaw  the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women  which was adopted in      by the u 
 general assembly and now ratified by nearly all countries 
 is one of the very few countries that have not ratified it 
 the equal employment opportunities commission should actively investigate and prosecute sexual harassment complaints 
 women who file complaints must not be persecuted and should be protected under federal and state law 
 we must enshrine in law the basic principle that women have the same rights as men  and promote gender equality and fairness in the work force to ensure that women receive equal pay for jobs of equal worth 
 we support the inclusion of an equal number of women and men in peace talks and negotiations  not only because these efforts directly affect their lives and those of their spouses  partners  significant others  children and families  but also because when women are involved  the negotiations are more successful 
 reproductive rights womens rights must be protected and expanded to guarantee each womans right as a full participant in society  free from sexual harassment  job discrimination or interference in the intensely personal choice about whether to have a child 
 womens right to control their bodies is non negotiable 
 it is essential that the option of a safe  legal abortion remains available 
 the morning after pill must be affordable and easily accessible without a prescription  together with a government sponsored public relations campaign to educate women about this form of contraception 
 clinics must be accessible and must offer advice on contraception and the means for contraception  consultation about abortion and the performance of abortions  and abortion regardless of age or marital status 
 we endorse womens right to use contraception and  when they choose  to have an abortion 
 this right cannot be limited to womens age or marital status 
 contraception and abortion must be included in all health insurance policies in the u 
  and any state government must be able to legally offer these services free of charge to women at the poverty level 
 public health agencies operating abroad should be allowed to offer family planning  contraception  and abortion in all countries that ask for those services 
 we oppose our governments habit of cutting family planning funds when those funds go to agencies in foreign countries that give out contraceptive devices  offer advice on abortion  and perform abortions 
 we encourage women and men to prevent unwanted pregnancies 
 it is the inalienable right and duty of every woman to learn about her body and to be aware of the phases of her menstrual cycle  and it is the duty for every man to be aware of the functions and health of his and his partners bodies 
 this information is necessary for self determination  to make informed decisions  and to prevent unintended consequences 
 unplanned conception takes control away from individuals and makes them subject to external controls 
 economic equality nationally  women as a whole earn only a portion of what men earn and women of color earn even less  despite the u 
 we support intensified effort to see this unfair gap closed  including support for the paycheck fairness act and similar legislation  and greater effort at enforcement 
 single mothers are the largest and most severely impoverished group in the united states  which explains why a substantial number of children in our country live below the poverty line 
 welfare reform has forced mothers to abandon their children while they travel to work at minimum wage jobs 
 with the extreme pay inequity  single mothers cannot afford child care  nurture their children  and move out of poverty 
 the green party supports real reforms to end poverty and return dignity and opportunity to all mothers 
 we call for implementing innovative programs that work with the particular and special needs of motherhood 
 we also support other programs such as a universal basic income  known also as a guaranteed income or citizen dividend  as described in true cost pricing and tax fairness  iv 
  that will provide for those who nurture the next generation work that is of incalculable importance to our society 
 sexual equality and protection from exploitation we affirm the womanhood of asexual  bisexual  heterosexual  intersex  lesbian  polyamorous  and transgender women and their right to be treated with dignity and respect 
 we affirm the right of all women to experience and enjoy sexuality  particularly those who have been denied such rights in the past 
 the expression of our unique sexuality is a human right and we support laws that protect this right 
 we support decriminalizing sex for pay by consenting adults so that the people who have sex for pay can make full use of legal  health and labor protections for protection against abuse and exploitation 
 we support the right of people who have sex for pay to receive public services  including medical treatment  child care and housing  and access to education  unemployment benefits and social security 
 we support criminal laws to prevent forced sex for pay  human trafficking  abuse and violence 
 we acknowledge that discrimination  marginalization and other structural inequities affect peoples decision to engage in sex for pay and we support government benefits  job training and educational programs for those who want to leave the industry 
 policies of decriminalizing both the seller and purchaser of sex have shown the potential to reduce harm to workers but the data is not conclusive regarding whether they increase trafficking 
 the green party will support the policy that shows the greatest efficacy in reducing trafficking while increasing worker safety and ensuring fairness and equity for women in all economic levels around the world 
 we support laws that protect children from all forms of exploitation 
 this includes protection from sexual exploitation  child prostitution and all forms of sexual abuse  violence and harassment  including pressuring or forcing children to engage in sexual activity and the use of children in pornographic acts and materials 
 early or forced marriage and harmful traditions such as genital mutilation shall be prohibited 
 violence and oppression language is often used as a weapon by those with power  and women have traditionally borne the brunt of inflicted injuries 
 however  we believe that this freedom should not be used to perpetuate oppression and abuse 
 all people have the right to be free from violence  including all physical and psychological abuse and economic exploitation  sexual harassment and violence  rape and other forms of coerced sex  including in or outside marriage or partnerships  in detention  and in armed conflict violence against women is increasing nationwide 
 we must address the root cause of all violence even as we specifically address violence to women 
 we support stronger legislation  programs and enforcement 
 we also call for new dialog and re thinking that can lead to better language  ideas and solutions 
 we urge that the term domestic violence be replaced by the term violence  because domestic violence is not perceived as real violence  which leads to it not being treated legally and practically for the violence that it is 
 we urge that the term sex work not be used in relation to prostitution 
 with the increasing conflation of trafficking  the violent and illegal trafficking in women and girls for forced sex  with prostitution  it is impossible to know which is which  and what violence the term sex work is masking 
 no source in existence knows which forms of prostitution comprise forced sex and which comprise free will or choice prostitution 
 an increasing number of experts think the percentage of choice prostitution is very small  leaving the larger number of women exposed to serious and often fatal violence 
 much of what is commonly called prostitution is actually sex trafficking by definition 
 the green party calls for a safer world for women and girls 
 the green party has zero tolerance for the illegal international trafficking in humans 
 of the millions of humans trafficked worldwide  the large majority are women and children who are bought and sold as slaves 
 they are kept captive and in debt bondage that can never be paid off 
 most are sold over and over again for forced sex prostitution 
 some are forced to labor in agriculture  sweat shops  hotels  restaurants  domestic service and other forms of servitude 
 coercive tactics including deception  fraud  intimidation  isolation  threat and use of physical force  or debt bondage are used to control women 
 vary greatly from        to        to over         with a worldwide estimate of over    million  the majority of which are women and girls 
 the green party supports all efforts to eradicate this extreme abuse of human rights  including but not limited to enforcement of existing laws and passage of tough new ones  punishing traffickers  aiding victims  increasing public awareness  reforming immigration laws  supporting existing programs and creating new ones 
 we support the state departments annual trafficking in persons report as an important document to begin to combat this abuse 
 we support and urge enforcement of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act  hr       signed into law on october          
 this act authorizes funding for the prevention of trade in human beings and for protecting victims 
 it gives the state department an historic opportunity to create an office with the exclusive responsibility of ending traffic in humans and protecting the victims of this worldwide trade 
 we urge committed political support to achieve the cooperation of all different levels of government 
 legislation relating to prostitution modeled on the swedish law passed in       now adopted by other countries and being considered by more  that has drastically reduced human trafficking and prostitution in sweden 
 that law criminalizes the purchase of services from prostitutes  pimps and brothel keepers instead of criminalizing the prostitutes 
 to open dialogs and visit with sweden as a step toward introducing legislation in the u 
 congress to address the exploitation  violence and harm to women through prostitution 
 the green party supports all efforts to eradicate this extreme abuse of human rights  including but not limited to enforcement of existing laws and passage of tough new ones  punishing traffickers  aiding victims  increasing public awareness  reforming immigration laws  supporting existing programs and creating new ones 
 we support the state departments annual trafficking in persons report as an important document to begin to combat this abuse 
 we support and urge enforcement of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act  hr       signed into law on october          
 this act authorizes funding for the prevention of trade in human beings and for protecting victims 
 it gives the state department an historic opportunity to create an office with the exclusive responsibility of ending traffic in humans and protecting the victims of this worldwide trade 
 we urge committed political support to achieve the cooperation of all different levels of government 
 the green party urges a more thorough dialog and understanding of violence against women and girls  including from prostitution and trafficking  that causes health and injury damage that seriously degrades their lives  even to death or premature death including from hiv  syphilis and many other diseases  as well as causing severe economic hardships 
 we call for solutions to this enormous problem that can result in awareness and the introduction of legislation in the u 
 pathway to citizenship laws to oppress immigrants have been proposed by states  congress  and numerous administrations 
 millions of immigrants and supporters of justice for immigrants have marched in the streets 
 politicians have constantly stirred up anti immigrant sentiment among sections of the u 
 imperialism  a policy of extending a countrys power and influence through diplomacy or military force  and colonialism  the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country  occupying it with settlers  economic exploitation  unfair trade policies  economic sanctions  unequal distribution of assets  increase in violence  and climate change have caused many of the worlds citizens to migrate for better opportunities 
 we must address all peoples humanitarian needs as we chart a course toward a less cumbersome pathway to citizenship 
 the green party stands firmly for social justice for all living in this country regardless of immigration status 
 anything less would be inconsistent with our green values  and with our nations values 
 the green party strives for a world in which persons can freely choose to live in and work in any country they desire 
 we recognize that this would be impractical without reciprocity between nations 
 citizenship and immigration services there are over        forms  hundreds of immigration statuses  hefty annual renewal fees  and varying steps immigrants must take to start the process for their specific situation 
 many times applications are denied because the applicant submitted forms for the incorrect category and cause them to lose all filing fees paid up to that point  no refunds 
  this cumbersome immigration process along with unreasonable department of homeland security  dhs  and lawyers fees must be streamlined 
 inhumane treatment of immigrants immigration and customs enforcement  ice   local police  and for profit private prison corporations such as geo group and corecivic have taken advantage of the increase in anti immigrant legislation and created a symbiotic relationship 
 ices mission  to protect america from cross border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety 
 this mission is executed through the enforcement of more than     federal statutes and focuses on immigration enforcement and combating transnational crime  subscribes to the belief that every latin american citizen is a criminal 
 mass incarceration fuels the proliferation of for profit prisons while for profit prison corporations encourage policies that increase the number of people behind bars 
 with various states implementing anti immigrant legislation  setting up detention centers has been an easy contractual agreement with the incentive that they must meet     to      fill capacity for payment 
 ice reports they have paid         per incarcerated individual and a total of      million to    for profit detention centers 
 undocumented immigrants boost americas economic growth and raise the general productivity of american workers by providing much needed skills 
 immigrant workers allow important sectors of the economy to expand  attract investment and create employment opportunities for native born americans  contribute more in tax revenue than they collect  reduce american firms incentives to offshore jobs and import foreign produced goods  and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services 
 economists estimate that legalization of the undocumented immigrant population would increase the immigrants earnings and consumption considerably  and increase u 
 needs a complete overhaul of its immigration laws  procedures  and programs 
 our current situation has created extreme social injustice 
 millions of people are living and working in the u 
 with no legal status  making them subject to extreme exploitation and abuse 
 immigration raids are terrorizing the immigrant community 
 employer abuses of undocumented workers are rampant 
 immigration policies such as separating families at the border  kids in cages  and the title    program which allows the united states border patrol and u 
 customs to prohibit the entry of persons who potentially pose a health risk  a racist policy to fast track deportations and prohibit refugees to seek asylum on u 
 the green party must consider immigration issues from an international standpoint  taking into account international labor and environmental standards  and human rights 
 the following proposals may not yield perfect answers  but they provide better answers than the status quo 
 we must recognize that there cannot be any true solutions to the conflicts created by immigration until we are able to organize globally to overcome the power of multinational corporations  which are engaged in an unending campaign to drive down workers living standards everywhere 
 international cooperation and solidarity among labor organizations  to advance the rights of labor and raise such living standards globally  are essential to combat this trend 
 until the power of the multinationals is curbed  we will continue to be confronted with seemingly no win choices 
 when the government has the power to deny legal rights and due process to one vulnerable group  everyones rights are at risk 
 we must end xenophobia and white supremacy to address laws and practices that punish and target individuals for their immigration status  national origin  ethnicity and race  to build power among the people 
 we must stand up for community members who have been excluded  oppressed  and maltreated and for people who have been subjected to multiple systems of oppression and exclusion 
 our goal is for the many diverse immigrant communities to possess true freedom and equality 
 we propose the following immigration policies  consistent with the ten key values 
 policy reform in many countries economic policies  military actions of the u 
 based corporations  and natural disasters have caused extreme hardships 
 these individuals must be prioritized to escape the intolerable conditions 
 we believe all immigrants must be granted a pathway to citizenship without cumbersome fees nor civil rights restrictions 
 in addition  we demand a recognition of past  uncredited payments into social security as part of any fees assessed for regularization of status 
 persons should only be excluded if their background check presents a clear and present danger 
 we believe the following policies should be enacted  undocumented immigrants who are already residing and working in the united states  and their families  should be granted legal status which allows a pathway to citizenship 
 all daca and tps recipients must be immediately granted a pathway to citizenship 
 all essential workers such as farm workers must be granted permanent residency and a pathway citizenship permanent border passes to all citizens of latin america and canada whose identity can be traced and verified 
 the matricula consular should be accepted as one means of proving ones identity 
 work permits for citizens of latin america and canada must be easily obtainable  thereby decriminalizing the act of gainful employment 
 this action would help eliminate exploitation of undocumented persons by criminals engaged in human contraband  coyotes  and unethical employers 
 it would also help ensure that taxes will be paid in each corresponding nation per its laws 
 these measures will also help temporary residents from mexico and canada to secure driving privileges and liability insurance 
 all persons fleeing political  racial  religious  or other types of persecution must be welcomed and granted permanent resident status and a pathway to citizenship 
 the history of arbitrary denial of political asylum claims must end 
 particular attention should be given to those minorities who are political exiles and refugees and those whose lives would be at risk if asylum is not granted all those who are issued work permits must have the option to come and go from the u 
 they must also be granted a pathway to citizenship the long wait to petition for a family member to join them in the us 
 we must prioritize family reunification for the sake of safety 
 permanent residency should not be denied based on political views  racial or national origin  religious beliefs  sexual orientation  disability  or any other arbitrary basis 
 we must keep faith with our commitment to the united nations  to assist in the resettlement  including to our own country  of refugees currently stranded in refugee camps in other parts of the world 
 interim measures recognizing that a just reform of immigration policy may take some time  the green party supports  measures to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses if they can prove their identity and pass the required tests 
 this will improve road safety and allow the undocumented who are driving in any case to obtain insurance 
 measures to give legal status to undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school in the u 
 and who are otherwise qualified  to allow them to attend colleges and universities on an equal basis with other high school graduates 
 the green party is opposed to efforts to force undocumented youth into becoming cannon fodder for the u 
 reduce wait lists and make the system work more efficiently  current numeric caps on immigrant visas must be increased 
 the current system of quotas and preferences has to be thoroughly and realistically reformed 
 current backlogs must be brought up to date as soon as possible 
 wait times for processing and resolving immigration benefit applications should be reduced to no more than six months 
 pre      screening criteria for legal permanent residency and citizenship applications should be restored 
 immigrant workers do not compete for jobs with current citizens and should not be punished for being victims of u 
 we must stop using our tax dollars to subsidize corporate agribusiness and to promote poverty in latin america  and start using them to help reward environmentally responsible family farmers  encourage improved infrastructure and economic conditions in latin america  and raise labor standards  at home and abroad 
 here at home  we must also promote the policies  as outlined in the economy and workers rights sections of this platform  that can help us achieve a full employment economy at a living wage  including strictly enforcing and expanding the rights of all workers to form unions 
 we advocate an end to employer sanctions  which have been shown to hurt not only undocumented workers but also u 
 instead  the focus on employers must be to vigorously enforce our wage and labor laws 
 instead of further victimizing the victims of corporate globalization  create real opportunities and raise labor standards for all  we oppose the provision of current law which allows local police to become agents of the immigration agency 
 local policing functions should be totally separate from immigration enforcement 
 immigrants already have ample incentive to learn english 
 but when interaction with the government is limited to the english speaking  persons are put at additional risk of exploitation 
 the focus needs to be on providing adequate and accessible english language instruction and assistance 
 we advocate legislation to ensure that federal funds marked for communities to provide esl  english as second language  training  and health and social support services to immigrants actually go to them 
 when funds are spent in other areas  immigrants are being deprived of benefits that they earn as productive workers in their communities 
 meanwhile  courts  social service agencies  and all government agencies dealing with the public must provide trained and certified translators 
 additionally  the language rights of peoples who were in this land before it became part of the u 
  including native americans and mexicans in the southwest  must be recognized and respected 
 we oppose the militarization of our borders   mis using the national guard as border police  and building a wall between the u 
 this will further intensify the human rights disaster our immigration policy has become  as well as seriously harm border ecosystems 
 we demand an immediate end to policies designed to force undocumented border crossers into areas where conditions dramatically increase the risk of permanent injury or death  destruction of fragile environments  and the cutting off of corridors needed by wildlife for migration within their habitat 
 for these reasons we specifically oppose the walling off of both traditional urban crossing areas and of wilderness areas 
 we also call for the immediate dismantling of the border wall 
 we mourn the death of those thousands of men  women and children who have died trying to cross this border  where a couple of decades ago such deaths were virtually unheard of 
 we must resist proposals that use illegal immigration as an excuse to put us all under further government monitoring and control by means of a national id card or other identification or tracking systems 
 we also oppose the imposition of the  e verify  system to screen people applying for jobs 
 citizen workers who have been propagandized to support  tougher  measures to identify and apprehend undocumented workers need to carefully consider what they are asking for 
 the same snare they want the government to use against undocumented workers can easily be used to repress them 
 our government is already engaged in illegal spying and surveillance of its own citizens 
 a national id card system is one of the hallmarks of a totalitarian government or police state 
 we need to repeal the real id act and resist the establishment of any system that would suppress freedom to travel and require citizens and non citizens alike to  show their papers  and reveal their private information to government monitors at every turn 
 we demand recognition of the sovereignty of indigenous nations whose territories cross national boundaries 
 these indigenous nations have the right to determine the status of their members 
 we demand new policies and laws that deal more effectively and humanely with the victims of illegal international trafficking in humans primarily women and children who are bought  kidnapped  coerced  brutalized  defrauded  tricked  sold and marketed for forced sex  rape  and prostitution  with an estimated        trafficked to the u 
 we call for stiffer  more appropriate policy  structure and laws to deal with traffickers  and also demand that procedures to deport victims before the traffickers are prosecuted must be changed to allow the victims to testify against the traffickers  which plays a major role in bringing these cases to justice and helping stem the tide of this heinous crime 
 the victims of trafficking should have the option of permanent residence in the u 
 or return to their home countries  according to their own choice 
 reparations and a black agenda the development of the united states was tainted by the displacement of native americans and the barbaric institution of slavery  built upon the belief in white supremacy  which we as greens condemn 
 in slaverys aftermath  people of color have borne the brunt of violence and discrimination 
 the green party unequivocally condemns these evils  which continue to be a social problem of paramount significance 
 reparations the descendants of enslaved africans  whose ancestors endured centuries of human rights violations  including the transatlantic slave trade now recognized by the united nations as a crime against humanity  have legitimate claims to reparations including monetary compensation 
 as our nation has done in the past with respect to the choctaw  the lakota  the lambuth  and more recently for japanese americans and the european jewish community  reparations are now due to address the debt still owed to descendants of enslaved africans 
 we recognize that reparations are a debt  not charity  that is due from the government  corporations  and institutions that profited from slavery and racial exploitation 
 we believe in elevating the voices of black activists and leaders in policy development and decision making processes within the african american community  whose right to self determination and autonomy to chart the path to healing we fully recognize as part of the black agenda 
 black agenda while the specific elements of full and complete reparations are still evolving  the green partys existing platform positions already align with many other aspects of the black agenda 
 these alignments focus on environmental justice  economic equity  and community health  to empower black communities and address systemic inequalities 
 we support the following initial steps  aligning with the black agenda  establish a reparations trust fund financed by recovered wealth and other profits accumulated from the slave trade 
 funds will be sourced from recovered wealth amassed by slave trade beneficiaries  corporations that profited from racial exploitation  and potential taxes on wealth accumulated through historical systemic disparities 
 descendants of enslaved africans  through their chosen representatives and organizations  will have a central role in shaping the calculation  distribution  and use of the reparations trust fund 
 we recognize that money is the governing factor and that our privately owned debt based financial system is rooted in the exploitation of people and the planet 
 it has perpetuated the legacy of colonialism  slavery  and systemic discrimination 
 to achieve true equity and sustainability  we must fundamentally transform our nations current monetary system to a public asset based system 
 this will enable our elected representatives to address all the economic injustices  including nurturing black businesses  closing the racial wealth gap  providing crucial financial resources and support services directly to black entrepreneurs and cooperatives  empowering us to thrive and contribute to the economic well being of our communities 
 we recognize that full employment and a national minimum wage are essential to achieving both economic justice and environmental sustainability 
 we support prioritizing green jobs and investment in historically disadvantaged communities  alongside policies like worker cooperatives and a guaranteed minimum income funded by progressive taxation  to finally break the cycle of poverty and end environmental racism 
 initiate the repeal of the slave clauses within the u 
 they contribute to ongoing racial disparities  mass incarceration  and other injustices 
 work to restore lands stolen from black communities through various discriminatory practices like the sharecropping system and land ownership restrictions that continue to impact black farmers opportunities and success 
 we also demand access to safe  secure  and affordable housing free from discriminatory practices like redlining and forced evictions 
 we support policies that empower us to plan and preserve our land or neighborhoods  prioritize community needs over large scale displacement  and invest in culturally sensitive revitalization efforts 
 support the release of all political prisoners held by the usa 
 state to imprison black individuals whose imprisonment stems from their defense of black peoples democratic and self determination rights  regardless of the specific location or movement associated with their activities 
 support existing historically black colleges and universities  hbcus  and education and development funds 
 take action to overcome the effects of over     years of racial discrimination  including ending official support for any remaining symbols of slavery  specifically call for the removal of the confederate battle flag from all government buildings  and addressing issues like racial profiling  police brutality  voting rights  and access to language resources 
 we oppose discriminatory english only pressure groups 
 we call for a national language policy that would encourage all citizens to be fluent in at least two languages 
 we strongly support the vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws  the aggressive prosecution of hate crimes  and the strengthening of legal services for the poor  including  black women  we pledge full partnership with black women as architects of our liberation  wielding power equally to build a world free from oppression 
 self defense  when facing violence  the right to defend ourselves is intrinsic 
 while advocating peaceful solutions  we affirm self defense as a tool for justice 
 voting rights  winner take all denies true representation 
 we demand proportional voting systems that amplify black voices  reflecting our diverse aspirations 
 protect and preserve african african american cemeteries we call upon government agencies at all levels to protect and preserve african african american cemeteries in the us and its territories 
 special attention is needed to ensure that these sacred burial grounds are identified and appropriately marked to prevent accidental or intentional desecration 
 the erasure of african african american history  such as the desecration of african cemeteries  is the bedrock and foundation of white supremacy 
 desecration is one of the physical manifestations of genocide and historic trauma 
 the green party calls for the immediate cessation of any and all drilling  excavation and or digging of soils in all african african american cemeteries in the us and its territories 
 we call for the department of justice to bring criminal charges against all parties involved in the desecration of any such cemetery 
 we call for reparations and the immediate repatriation of all remains and bone fragments previously displaced from any such cemeteries to the descendant community 
 the destruction of cemeteries and graveyards is understood to be a distinct form of cultural violence 
 cultural destruction during genocidal campaigns is a dimension of genocide itself and is evidence of the intent to completely erase the targeted group from existence 
     killing the dead  the logic of cemetery destruction during genocidal campaigns  noa krikler  european institute  march          doi     
      we understand that such desecration is a violent  political  cultural  and spiritual act  perpetuated by those holding political and economic power committed to erasing the legacy  significance  history  memory  and ancestry of the oppressed to dominate and hold hegemonic power 
 desecration seeks to launder and plunder sacred land  thus transferring wealth from vulnerable groups to landowning aristocracies 
 indigenous peoples we have great respect for native american cultures  especially their deference for community and the earth 
 we recognize both the sovereignty of native american tribal governments and the federal governments trust obligation to native american people 
 native american nations are just that nations and should be treated in like fashion  with the special circumstance that they are located within the united states 
 the federal government is obligated to deal in good faith with native americans  honor its treaty obligations  adequately fund programs for the betterment of tribal governments and their people  affirm the religious rights of native americans in ceremonies  american indian religious freedom act   provide funds for innovative economic development initiatives  education and public health programs  and respect land  water and mineral rights within the borders of reservations and traditional lands 
 we support efforts to broadly reform the bureau of indian affairs to make this vast agency more responsible and more responsive to tribal governments 
 we support the just settlement of the claims of the thousands of native american uranium miners who have suffered and died from radiation exposure 
 we condemn the stance of secrecy taken by the atomic energy commission during this era and its subsequent claim of government immunity  taken knowingly and immorally at the expense of native people 
 we support the complete clean up of those mines and tailing piles  which are a profoundly destructive legacy of the cold war 
 native american land and treaty rights often stand as the front line against government and multinational corporate attempts to plunder energy  mineral  timber  fish  and game resources  pollute water  air  and land in the service of the military  expand economically  and consume natural resources 
 we support legal  political  and grassroots efforts by  and on behalf of  native americans to protect their traditions  rights  livelihoods  and sacred spaces 
 the green party supports the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands  their ways of life  and all other rights of free peoples 
 we support the declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples adopted by the un general assembly on september           and call for its provisions to be actively supported by our own government and by governments worldwide 
 justice for native hawaiians  kanaka maoli since illegal annexation in       the federal and state governments have cheated and neglected the native hawaiian people 
 congress passed  and president clinton signed into law  the  apology bill   u 
 this admission of crime states in part   the native hawaiians have never lost their inherent sovereignty nor their national home base 
  the green party demands justice for kanaka maoli 
 we support the following  protecting sacred and culturally significant sites 
 kanaka maoli leadership and guardianship in protecting gathering rights  and lobbying the legislature to safeguard these rights without interference 
 return of  or fair compensation for  ceded lands

 hawaiian sovereignty in a form that is fair to both native hawaiians and other residents of hawaii 
 we acknowledge and actively endorse the inherent and absolute right of indigenous nations to self determination  and thereby call upon the u 
 government to reverse its opposition to enactment of the proposed united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples in its entirety 
 sexual orientation and gender identity in keeping with the green key values of diversity  social justice and feminism  we support full legal and political equality for all persons regardless of sex  gender  sexual orientation  or gender identity  characteristics  and expression 
 the green party affirms the rights of all individuals to freely choose intimate partners  regardless of their sex  gender  or gender identity 
 the green party recognizes the full civil rights of sexual and gender minorities 
 the existing civil rights act prohibits discriminating on the basis of race  color  national origin  religion  sex  age  and disability 
 we will work to add sexual orientation  gender identity  and gender expression to the existing civil rights act 
 the green party will be inclusive of language in local  state and federal anti discrimination law that ensures the rights of intersex individuals and prohibits discrimination based on gender identity  characteristics  and expression as well as on sex  gender  or sexual orientation

 the green party would end security surveillance and covert infiltration of organizations that promote rights for sexual and gender minorities 
 rights of the disabled we support the full enforcement of the americans with disabilities act to enable all people with disabilities to achieve independence and function at the highest possible level 
 government should work to ensure that children with disabilities are provided with the same educational opportunities as those without disabilities 
 the physically and mentally challenged are people who are differently abled from the majority  but who are nevertheless able to live independently 
 the mentally ill are people with serious mental problems who often need social support networks 
 physically and mentally challenged people have the right to live independently in their communities 
 the mentally ill also have the right to live independently  circumscribed only by the limitations of their illness 
 these people are their own best advocates in securing their rights and for living in the social and economic mainstream 
 current medicaid policy forces many challenged people to live in costly state funded institutions 
 excluding these people from society alienates them  excluding them from the work force denies them the chance to use their potentials 
 the diminishing funds available to provide care for the growing number of the mentally ill often result in their homelessness  vagrancy and dependence on short term crisis facilities 
 lack of funding also increases the necessity ofplacing them in long term  locked facilities 
 the green party urges the government to  increase rehabilitation funding so that persons with disabilities can pursue education and training to reach their highest potential 
 the differently abled should participate fully in the allocation decisions of state rehabilitation departments funds 
 aggressively implement the americans with disabilities act 
 the green party supports the ratification of the united nations convention on rights for persons with disabilities as well as the optional protocol 
 fund in home support services to allow the differently abled to hire personal care attendants while remaining at home 
 allocate adequate funding to support community based programs that provide out patient medical services  case management services and counseling programs

 increase teacher training in regard to the needs of differently abled students 
 discourage stereotyping of the mentally and physically challenged by the entertainment industry and the media

 religious freedom and secular equality the united states bill of rights guarantees freedom of religion 
 we affirm the right of each individual to the exercise of conscience and religion  while maintaining the constitutionally mandated separation of government and religion 
 we believe that federal  state  and local governments must remain neutral regarding religion 
 we call for  ending discriminatory federal  state  and local laws against particular religious beliefs  and non belief 
 constitution states that there shall be no religious test for public office 
 this requirement should apply to oaths  or affirmations  for holding public office at any level  employment at all government levels  oaths for witnesses in courts  oaths for jury membership  and the oath for citizenship 
 prosecution of hate crimes based on religious affiliation or practice 
 elimination of displays of religious symbols  monuments  or statements on government buildings  property  websites  money  or documents

 youth rights all human beings have the right to a life that will let them achieve their full potential 
 young people are one of the least protected classes of human beings  yet they represent our future 
 we must ensure they have an upbringing that allows them to take their place as functioning  productive  and self actualized members of their community 
 youth are not the property of their parents or guardians  but are under their care and guidance 
 youth have the right to survive by being provided adequate food  shelter and comprehensive health care  including prenatal care for mothers 
 youth have the right to be protected from abuse  harmful drugs  violence  environmental hazards  neglect  and exploitation 
 youth have the right to develop in a safe and nurturing early environment provided by affordable childcare and pre school preparation 
 youth have the right to an education that is stimulating  relevant  engaging  and that fosters their natural desire to learn 
 young peoples creative potential should be encouraged to the greatest extent possible 
 young people should have input into the direction and pace of their own education  including input into the operation of their educational institutions 
 young people should be provided with education regarding their own and others sexuality at the earliest appropriate time 
 young people should be provided the opportunity to express themselves in their own media  including television  radio  films and the internet 
 young people should also be given skills in analyzing commercial media 
 young people should be kept free from coercive advertising at their educational institutions 
 lower the voting age to    for all elections to give young people the right to take part in deciding their future 
 gi and veterans rights support for men and women in the armed forces must go far beyond the rhetoric used to discredit the peace movement in the u 
 we believe that the ill advised and illegal actions of the u 
 administration have unnecessarily put our troops in harms way 
 we further believe that the dangerous burden of fighting the unnecessary wars in the middle east  due to the administrations overly narrow and militaristic response to terrorism is disproportionately borne by families of lesser means 
 those who are required to carry out militaristic policies  often with great hardship to themselves  their families  and even the risk of their lives  deserve our respect and our commitment to adequate compensation and benefits 
 our first priority in foreign policy considerations is to creating a future without war 
 we are committed that future generations not face the separations and sacrifices of war 
 we recommend the following actions  increase the current pay levels  including monthly combat pay  imminent danger pay and family separation allowances for those risking their lives in combat zones 
 provide better care for the wounded  sick and injured soldiers 
 restore full funding for veterans health programs 
 ensure that the pentagon takes all steps necessary to fully diagnose and treat the physical and mental health conditions resulting from service in combat zones  including post traumatic stress disorder 
 support increased funding for additional clinics to provide services which now are too often delayed or denied throughout the veterans affairs system because of over crowding and budget constraints 
 ensure that all pre deployment physicals are completed within the standard allotted time period  and that medical follow ups are routinely given to all soldiers 
 honor all laws concerning time limits on deployments 
 ensure a smooth transition from active military service to civilian life by providing counseling  housing  emergency management  job protection and other support systems 
 soldiers  sailors  marines and airmen who served during u 
 wars in recent decades have been exposed to nuclear  chemical and possibly biological warfare agents 
 we insist that the veterans administration cant ignore their suffering since coming home from the war 
 the congress should fund and the va should implement a comprehensive program to survey vets and the impacts of their deployment on them and their families and to provide the best possible medical treatment available to minimize the suffering of these men and women and their families 
 veterans are being unfairly discharged from the service with post traumatic stress disorder  ptsd  and other injuries caused by stress  trauma and head injuries  under trumped up behavioral charges  as a means of military budget cost cutting 
 combatants are entitled to medical and psychiatric health care by the va  after serving any time in a combat zones 
 service members serving in combat zones are subjected to assorted variations of permanent physical and mental damage and are entitled to treatment by the veterans administration 
 this nation has a moral obligation to provide health care services and disability entitlements to its veterans 
 we support funding for additional clinics to provide services which noware too often delayed or denied because of over crowding and budget constraints throughout the va system 
 provide recognized  independent veteran organizations with access to military personnel to ensure they are being informed of their rights  including those who are hospitalized due to service related injuries or illnesses 
 establish a panel of independent medical doctors to examine and oversee the military policies regarding forced vaccinations and shots  especially with experimental drugs

 support a transparent and democratic conscientious objection process free of harassment  imprisonment  or deployment to war zones for conscientious objectors 
 defend the right of individuals in the military service to modify or completely separate from military involvement because of conscientious objection 
 consumer protection the green party supports strong consumer protections against fraud  dangerous products  inadequately tested and potentially harmful pharmaceuticals  environmentally harmful planned obsolescence  excessive interest rates and fees by financial institutions and excessive corporate profits 
 we believe that prevention and justice are at the heart of consumer protection 
 millions of lives will be saved or lost depending on the strength of our consumer protection laws 
 we aim to stop corporations and others from defrauding consumers or endangering them with defective products or negligence 
 we believe in informed consent and individual autonomy regarding medical decisions 
 we advocate for strong safeguards to ensure patients have access to accurate and comprehensive information about treatment options  potential risks and benefits  and the right to refuse any treatment without penalty or discrimination 
we stand with consumers  who have been harmed by corporations  health care industries  or any other entity  and support their efforts to redress the wrongs done to them 
 we defend whistleblowers who expose corporate misconduct  healthcare negligence  financial fraud  and wasteful practices 
 we recommend the following actions  strengthen product safety standards and enforcement for a variety of products  including food  motor vehicles  transportation systems  electronics  consumer goods  medical products  and addictive substance restore state health  safety  and consumer protection laws by striking federal preemptions that undermine state regulations on environmental standards  food safety  labor practices  and product liability 
 preserve and expand product labeling requirements to ensure that consumers are fully informed about the origin  ingredients  and ecological life cycle of all products  disclosing any animal or human testing involved in the products development or production  and the products organic  recycled  and genetically engineered content 
 require clear and accessible labeling on the nutritional content  including vegetarian and vegan information  for food  beverages  toiletries  and clothing products 
 medical and dental products should follow relevant regulatory labeling requirements 
 require stringent eco labeling requirements which show the environmental impacts associated with the production or use of a product 
 this may include land use  water use  waste byproducts  emissions  and more 
 prohibit corporations from concealing information about public health  labor conditions or environmental safety via protective orders or confidential settlements 
 empower consumers through expanded class action rights against manufacturers of unsafe products and practices 
 we call for a strengthened civil justice system with adequate resources to prevent consumer harm  deter corporate wrongdoing  and ensure timely and effective justice for those already impacted protect whistleblowers and employees who refuse to participate in illegal conduct or conduct that otherwise is harmful to the public interest  from any form of retaliation 
 while acknowledging the need for improvements in legal processes  we oppose tort reforms that limit consumers ability to seek fair redress for legitimate grievances 
 we similarly call for healthcare reforms that prioritize patient safety and hold medical professionals accountable for negligence  while promoting open communication and a culture of continuous improvement 
 grant consumers the right to limit collection and secondary use of personal information by any commercial entity particularly through invasive data collection practices  ai powered surveillance  and other privacy violating technologies 
 advocate for comprehensive usury laws that protect consumers from all forms of predatory lending  including excessive interest rates  hidden  excessive or unwarranted fees and other abusive terms prohibit the widespread practice of price gouging that disproportionately harms vulnerable consumers and exacerbates economic inequality 
 reform the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of      to restore fair access to chapter   bankruptcy as a viable final safety net for those burdened by medical bills  predatory loans  and student debt 
 economic justice requires accessible paths to financial recovery 
 ban the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts  employment and healthcare agreements  stripping individuals of their rights and access to fair dispute resolution processes  ensuring equal access to justice 
 office of consumer affairs by granting the necessary authority and resources to coordinate consumer protection efforts across existing agencies  fill gaps in current systems  and address emerging issues empower communities to take control of their utilities by forming strong  well supported citizens utility boards 
 we support policies that make formation easier  amplify voices  and enable lower costs  cleaner energy  and a more accountable and sustainable utility landscape 
 adoptee rights due to current laws millions of adults that were adopted as children are now being denied access to vital records regarding their births 
 this is a basic human right that the green party should be committed to help in abolishing the secrets and lies that surround many adoptions around the world by creating necessary transparency between adoptees  their mothers and adoptive parents 
 reform items include the following  immediate and direct access to all identifying birth  hospital  foster care and adoption agency records and files concerning the adult adoptee  including the original adoption plans and any contracts that pertain to the adoptee or in which they are mentioned  to assist with researching their genealogy  medical history and the truth regarding the circumstances surrounding their adoptions and  if applicable  their time in foster care 
 strict financial penalties need to be enforced when birth adoption records have been lost or destroyed while under the care of agencies  hospitals  lawyers  etc 
 that have assumed the responsibility of storing these vital records 
 full reparations for historical injustices in adoption 
 environmental justice the green party supports a holistic approach to justice  recognizing that environmental justice  social justice and economic justice depend on and support each other 
 we believe that no one including people of color and the poor should be poisoned nor subjected to harmful levels of toxic chemicals and that no group of people should bear a disproportionate share of the pollution from industrial  governmental and commercial sources or policies 
 across the united states  the poor and people of color do suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards in the workplace  at home  and in their communities 
 inadequate environmental laws  lax enforcement  and weak penalties for environmental violations undermine environmental integrity  public health and civil rights 
 environmental justice is the crossroads of environmental activism and the civil rights movement 
 it is founded on two fundamental beliefs  that all people have the right to live  work  learn  and play in safe and healthful environments  and that people have the right to influence decisions that affect environmental quality in their communities 
 we believe that government must ensure the fair treatment of people of all races  cultures  and incomes with respect to the development  adoption  implementation  and enforcement of environmental laws  regulations and policies 
 to accomplish this  we unconditionally support implementation of the principle of environmental justice in our practices  policies and laws across the nation 
 we recommend the following actions  make  pollution prevention  the preferred strategy for dealing with environmental justice issues  through eliminating environmental threats before they occur and considering cumulative environmental impacts when evaluating risk 
 uphold the precautionary principle  requiring polluters to bear the burden of proof in demonstrating the safety of their practices 
 expand the application of the precautionary principle from chemicals and health to land use  waste  energy  food policy and local economic development 
 expand the public trust doctrine  which holds that governments role is to protect the commons  to include the domains of public health and protection of the natural environment 
 promote programs  policies  and legislation that build the capacity to identify disproportionate or discriminatory siting of polluting or toxic facilities 
 assure non discriminatory compliance with all environmental  health and safety laws to guarantee equal protection 
 facilitate procedural justice  ensuring the publics right to know 
 ensure rules and regulations are transparent to help communities employ their rights and participate in decision making 
 provide information in languages appropriate to the affected communities 
 enforce corrective justice  ensuring the rights of communities and local agencies to seek judicial redress 
 communities and local agencies must not be required to show or prove  intent to discriminate  to achieve redress for problems of disproportionate and or racist environmental impacts 
 target precautionary and corrective justice actions and resources in communities with the highest concentrations of environmental hazards and in communities lacking socioeconomic resources 
 support  enforce and strengthen the national environmental policy act 
 economic justice   social safety net the passage of the      welfare act by congress and its signing by the president confronts us with hard choices 
 democrats and republicans seem to be saying the country cannot afford to care for children and poor mothers 
 in ending over fifty years of federal policy guaranteeing cash assistance for poor children  congress has set in motion a radical experiment that will have a profound impact on the lives of the weakest members of our society 
 how will state  city and county governments  local communities  businesses and religious institutions all of us respond  we have a special responsibility to the health and wellbeing of the young 
 yet we see the federal safety net being removed and replaced with limited and potentially harsh state welfare programs 
 how will social services be adequately provided if local resources are already stretched thin  we believe our community priorities must first protect the young and helpless 
 yet how will state legislatures and agencies  under pressure from more powerful interests  react  we believe local decision making is important  but we realize  as we learned during the civil rights era  that strict federal standards must guide state actions in providing basic protections 
 as the richest nation in history  we should not condemn millions of children to a life of poverty  while corporate welfare is increased to historic highs 
 the green party opposes the privatization of social security 
 it is critical that the public protections of social security are not privatized and subjected to increased risk 
 the bottom     of american senior citizens get roughly     of their income from social security  and without social security  nearly     of black elderly and     of latino elderly households would be in poverty 
 welfare  a commitment to ending poverty an unjust society is an unsustainable society 
 when communities are stressed by poverty  violence and despair  our ability to meet the challenges of the post industrial age are critically impaired 
 a holistic  future focused perspective on how we distribute resources in this country would consider the effects of such distribution not just on our present needs  but on the seventh generation to come 
 it is time for a radical shift in our attitude toward support for families  children  the poor and the disabled 
 such support must not be given grudgingly  it is the right of those presently in need and an investment in our future 
 we must take an uncompromising position that the care and nurture of children  elders and the disabled are essential to a healthy  peaceful  and sustainable society 
 we should recognize that the work of their caregivers is of social and economic value  and reward it accordingly 
 ensuring that children and their caregivers have access to an adequate  secure standard of living should form the cornerstone of our economic priorities 
 only then can we hope to build our future on a foundation of healthy  educated children who are raised in an atmosphere of love and security 
 all people have a right to food  housing  medical care  jobs that pay a living wage  education  and support in times of hardship 
 work performed outside the monetary system has inherent social and economic value  and is essential to a healthy  sustainable economy and peaceful communities 
 such work includes  child and elder care  homemaking  voluntary community service  continuing education  participating in government  and the arts 
 we call for restoration of a federally funded entitlement program to support children  families  the unemployed  elderly and disabled  with no time limit on benefits 
 this program should be funded through the existing welfare budget  reductions in military spending and corporate subsidies  and a fair  progressive income tax 
 we call for a graduated supplemental income  or negative income tax  that would maintain all individual adult incomes above the poverty level  regardless of employment or marital status 
 we advocate reinvesting a significant portion of the military budget into family support  living wage job development  and work training programs 
 publicly funded work training and education programs should have a goal of increasing employment options at finding living wage jobs 
 we support public funding for the development of living wage jobs in community and environmental service 
 for example  environmental clean up  recycling  sustainable agriculture and food production  sustainable forest management  repair and maintenance of public facilities  neighborhood based public safety  aides in schools  libraries and childcare centers  and construction and renovation of energy efficient housing 
 we oppose enterprise zone giveaways  which benefit corporations more than inner city communities 
 it is clear that we cannot rely on the rich to regulate their profit making excesses for the good of society through  trickle down economics 
  we must take aggressive steps to restore a fair distribution of income 
 we support tax incentives for businesses that apply fair employee wage distribution standards  and income tax policies that restrict the accumulation of excessive individual wealth 
 forcing welfare recipients to accept jobs that pay wages below a living wage drives wages down and exploits workers for private profit at public expense 
 we reject workfare as being a form of indentured servitude 
 corporations receiving public subsidies must provide jobs that pay a living wage  observe basic workers rights  and agree to affirmative action policies 
 education the green party supports equal access to high quality education  and sharp increases in financial aid for college students 
 a great challenge facing the people of the united states is to educate ourselves to build a just  sustainable  humane and democratic future  and to become responsible and effective citizens of the local and global communities we share 
 greens believe every child deserves a public education that fosters critical and holistic thought  and provides the breadth and depth of learning necessary to become an active citizen and a constructive member of our society 
 we do not believe our public school system  as it presently operates  helps us reach that goal 
 today  americas public school system faces a different set of challenges 
 for the first time in this countrys history  students of color represent the majority of the pk    public education student body 
 additionally  now more than half of all school children are classified as low income 
 even more critical is the fact that now nearly    percent of all public school students have some specific learning disability and are receiving special education services 
 given these factors  in order for americas schools to truly become effective in teaching our students to think critically and to respond to life challenges  districts  schools and teachers must develop a new consciousness toward students that includes cultural competency  the understanding of the impact of poverty on school performance  asset based engagement and how to create stable  nurturing school environments that will help students thrive and succeed 
 therefore  greens work toward  dismantling white supremacy in our schools  represented in curricula  discipline  teacher recruitment and more  by seeking to end the school to jailhouse track free teachers from requirements to use exclusively common core standards aligned materials  which neglects the contributions and struggles of people of color 
 teachers should be free to choose whichever materials are academically challenging and culturally appropriate for their students 
 strengthen cultural competency requirements for teachers 
 provide robust professional development in cultural competency  and widen the scope of teacher preparation to include cultural competency training 
 end alternative teacher licensing initiatives  such as teach for america  which recruit primarily white teachers and inject them into urban classrooms with as little as five weeks training and only a two year commitment  creating great destabilization in school communities that need consistent leadership and community connections 
 incentivize  grow your own teacher  programs in oppressed communities with targeted recruitment during high school  federal grants and loan forgiveness and mentoring 
 invest more resources into recruiting fully bilingual school support staff  such as front office and family resource personnel and counselors 
 ensure school security personnel are trained for  and held accountable to  conflict resolution techniques and anti bias training 
 security personnel should also demonstrate cultural competency and refrain from enforcing white supremacist oppressive tactics 
 recognize the impact of poverty on student achievement  which no amount of sanctions  standards  turnarounds  teacher targeting or privatization will fix 
 implement strategies such as wraparound services and more to support students in poverty 
 eradicate the vestiges of structural racism represented through police violence  incarceration  school suspension and dropout rates  inequitable school funding and use of schemes like  student based budgeting   behavior policies based on  no excuses    character education  and  grit   and school closures 
 the green party is strongly opposed to the dissolution of public schools and the privatization of education 
 we believe that the best educational experience is guaranteed by the democratic empowerment of organized students  their parents and communities along with organized teachers 
 we should challenge students with great works of literature  economics  philosophy  history  music  and the arts as regular academic subjects 
 we must stop disinvestment in education and instead put it at the top of our social and economic agenda 
 too many of our teachers are overworked  underpaid  and starved of key materials 
 we do not think that schools should turn our children into servile students  employees  consumers or citizens 
 we believe it is very important to teach our children how to ask good questions 
 we also call attention to the results of a quarter century of corporate funding from the likes of the bradley and wal mart family foundations and a decade of no child left behind and its repackaged new offspring  the every student succeeds act  essa a vast  well endowed and lucrative sector which seeks to dismantle  privatize  or militarize public education and destroy teachers unions 
 regimes of high stakes standardized testing and the wholesale diversion of resources away from public schools are provoking crises for which the bipartisan corporate consensus recommends school closings  dissolution of entire school districts and replacement by unaccountable  profit based charter schools 
 the green party is unalterably opposed to the dissolution of public schools and the privatization of education 
 therefore  the green party advocates  that with the failure of nclbs testing mandate  recognize and uphold parents right to opt their children out of any standardized test  instead of essas weak permission of allowing states to pass such statutes 
 end the official bullying and threats from school and district officials when parents opt out 
 end all standardized testing and instead redirect the millions of funds allocated toward prep  materials  support  etc 
 to creating expanded access to music  arts  sciences and languages as mandatory  academic subjects 
 end all federal competitive grants like race to the top  rttt  and instead equitably fund schools based on a priority of socioeconomic level 
 essas passing the buck of  test and punish  to the states puts more authority in the hands of people with even less understanding of pedagogy and child development than even the us department of education 
 students of color  english learners and students with disabilities used to be able to count on federal oversight of their basic rights in school 
 end essas promotion of charter friendly  unproven alternative teaching licensing and  credential mills  like relay graduate school of education and others  that circumvent public oversight 
 the green party views learning as a lifelong and life affirming process to which all people should have access 
 we cannot state more forcefully our belief that in learning  and openness to learning  we find the foundation of our platform 
 we recommend the following actions  eliminate gross inequalities in school funding 
 federal policy on education should act principally to provide equal access to a quality education 
 provide free college tuition to all qualified students at public universities and vocational schools 
 abolish all student and parent loans taken out to finance post secondary and vocational education 
 oppose the administration of public schools by private  for profit entities 
 increase funding for after school and daycare programs 
 promote a diverse set of educational opportunities  including multilingual education  continuing education  job retraining  distance learning  mentoring and apprenticeship vocational programs 
 build education programs based on autochthonous skills  crafts  art  music  permaculture  and history 
 also present children of colonial heritage viable and sustainable ways of life of indigenous peoples worldwide 
 for students with disabilities  provide a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment  as inclusive as possible  
 provide curriculum designed for specific disabilities  as well as inclusive training for all teachers 
 improve transition programs for students with disabilities from ages       
 give k    classroom teachers professional status and salaries commensurate with advanced education  training and responsibility 
 teach non violent conflict resolution and humane education at all levels of education 
 implement and fully fund restorative justice programs as an alternative to suspension and police referral 
 provide age appropriate education on gender  race  ethnicity  sexual orientation  gender identity  age  and safer sex 
 corporations should not be allowed to use the schools as vehicles for commercial advertising or corporate propaganda 
 provide healthy school meals that are rich in vitamins  minerals  protein and fiber  and offer plant based vegetarian options 
 support farm to school programs that provide food from local family farms and educational opportunities 
 develop culturally sensitive menus and provide opportunities for parents to assist in meal preparation 
 ban the sale of soda pop and junk food in schools 
 junk food is defined as food or beverages that are relatively high in saturated or trans fat  added sugars or salt  and relatively low in vitamins  minerals  protein and fiber 
 oppose military and corporate control over the priorities and topics of university academic research 
 expand opportunities for universal higher education and life long learning 
 include a vigorous and engrossing civics curriculum in later elementary and secondary schools  to teach students to be active citizens 
 encourage parental responsibility by supporting parenting in culturally sensitive ways and increasing opportunities for parents to be as involved as possible in their childrens education 
 values start with parents and schools should not seek to de program students from those values 
 expand arts education and physical education opportunities at school 
 recognize the viable alternative of home based education and support working class parents who wish to offer it to their children 
 oppose efforts to restrict the teaching of scientific information and the portrayal of religious belief as fact

 make all public education sites gun free to provide a safe learning environment include self defense skills in the physical education curriculum at elementary school level provide researched based drug  tobacco  and alcohol abuse prevention  as well as evidence based information about the true effect of recreational or medicinal substances such as cannabis on the developing brain 
 include curricula focusing on civil rights history  actions  and advances  and how current law can be used to achieve personal civil rights 
 teach all students about white supremacy and intersectionality 
 we urge that our nation amend its binding declaration with respect to the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on the involvement of children in armed conflict to join the rest of the world in setting    as the absolute minimum age for military recruitment 
 no person should be permitted to sign away eight years of their life to the armed forces  without full written disclosure of what is expected of them and what they can expect in return from the government 
 we demand that the practice of deceiving prospective service recruits about the truth of their service contract be recognized as a fraudulent practice and sufficient grounds for revoking an enlistment contract 
 current practices holding individuals legally to all the terms of their military service contract should also apply to the government 
 we demand an end to the militarization of our schools 
 jrotc programs are an expensive drain on our limited educational resources and a diversion from their important mission to prepare our young to assume their role in a peaceful tomorrow 
 asvab testing is being used to mine public school student bodies for data to support military recruiting 
 the pentagons recruitment command is misdirecting public tax dollars on manipulative campaigns that prey on our young 
 we insist that local education authorities stand up to these destructive practices 
 educate students in grade school and higher education with courses in the environmental sciences  with a focus on the hands on practice of conservation agriculture  with organic  community farming gardening  increased emphasis on energy conservation  exposure to industrialized food production through field trips and educational films  at an appropriate age   and other courses that include a comprehensive curriculum on climate change  biodiversity  and other planetary boundaries and environmental concerns 
 focus on education through a general immersion in nature to understand  hands on  the intricate dependence of humanity upon the natural world 
 the arts freedom of artistic expression is a fundamental right and a key element in empowering communities  and in moving us toward sustainability and respect for diversity 
 artists can create in ways that foster healthy  non alienating relationships between people and their daily environments  communities  and the earth 
 this can include both artists whose themes advocate compassion  nurturance  or cooperation  and artists whose creations unmask the often obscure connections between various forms of violence  domination  and oppression  or effectively criticize aspects of the very community that supports their artistic activity 
 the arts can only perform their social function if they are completely free from outside control 
 the green party supports  alternative  community based systems treating neither the artwork nor the artist as a commodity 
 eliminating all laws that seek to restrict or censor artistic expression  including the withholding of government funds for political or moral content 
 increased funding for the arts appropriate to their essential social role at local  state and federal levels of government 
 community funded programs employing local artists to enrich their communities through public art programs  including public performances  exhibitions  murals on public buildings  design or re design of parks and public areas  storytelling and poetry reading  and publication 
 the establishment of non profit public forums for local artists to display their talents and creations 
 research  public dialogue  and trial experiments to develop alternative systems for the valuation and exchange of artworks and for the financial support of artists 
 some examples include community subscriber support groups  artwork rental busts  cooperative support systems among artists  legal or financial incentives to donate to the arts or to donate artworks to public museums 
 responsible choices of non toxic  renewable  or recyclable materials 
 funding sources not connected with social injustice or environmental destruction 
 education programs in the community that will energize the creativity of every community member from the youngest to the oldest  including neglected groups such as teenagers  senior citizens  prisoners  immigrants  and drug addicts 
 these programs would provide materials and access to interested  qualified arts educators for every member of the community who demonstrates an interest 
 funding and staffing to incorporate arts education into every school curriculum 
 we encourage local artists and the community to contribute time  experience  and resources to these efforts 
 diversity in arts education in the schools including age specific hands on activities and appreciative theoretical approaches  exposure to the arts of various cultures and stylistic traditions  and experiences with a variety of media  techniques and contents 
 the integration of the arts and artistic teaching methods into other areas of the curriculum to promote a holistic perspective 
 health care the green party supports single payer universal health care and preventive care for all 
 we believe that health care is a right  not a privilege 
 our current health care system lets tens of thousands of people die each year by excluding them from adequate care  while its exorbitant costs are crippling our economy 
 the united states is the only industrialized nation in the world without a national health care system 
 under a universal  comprehensive  national single payer health care system  the administrative waste of private insurance corporations would be redirected to patient care 
 if the united states were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer plan  as in canada and many european countries  the savings in administrative costs would be more than enough to offset the cost of additional care 
 expenses for businesses currently providing coverage would be reduced  while state and local governments would pay less because they would receive reimbursement for services provided to the previously uninsured  and because public programs would cease to be the  dumping ground  for high risk patients and those rejected by health maintenance organizations  hmos  when they become disabled and unemployed 
 in addition  people would gain the peace of mind in knowing that they have health care they need 
 no longer would people have to worry about the prospect of financial ruin if they become seriously ill  are laid off their jobs  or are injured in an accident 
 the green party supports a wide range of health care services  including conventional medicine  as well as the teaching  funding and practice of complementary  integrative and licensed alternative health care approaches 
 greens recognize that our own health is also intimately tied to the health of our communities and environment 
 to improve our own health  we must improve the quality of our air  water and food and the health of our workplaces  homes and schools 
 the green party unequivocally supports a womans right to reproductive choice  no matter her marital status or age  and that contraception and safe  legal abortion procedures be available on demand and be included in all health insurance coverage in the u 
  as well as free of charge in any state where a womans income falls below the poverty level 
 womens rights in this chapter  we recommend the following actions    
 single payer health care enact a universal  comprehensive  national single payer health plan that will provide the following with no increase in cost  a publicly funded health care insurance program  administered at the state and local levels  with comprehensive lifetime benefits  including dental  vision  mental health care  substance abuse treatment  medication coverage  and hospice and long term care  participation of all licensed and or certified health providers  subject to standards of practice in their field  with the freedom of patients to choose the type of health care provider from a wide range of health care choices  and with decision making in the hands of patients and their health providers  not insurance companies  portability of coverage regardless of geographical location or employment  cost controls via streamlined administration  national fee schedules  bulk purchases of drugs and medical equipment  coordination of capital expenditures and publicly negotiated prices of medications  primary and preventive care as priorities  including wellness education about diet  nutrition and exercise  holistic health  and medical marijuana 
 more comprehensive services for those who have special needs  including the mentally ill  the differently abled and those who are terminally ill  a mental health care system that safeguards human dignity  respects individual autonomy  and protects informed consent  greatly reduced paperwork for both patients and providers  fair and full reimbursement to providers for their services  hospitals that can afford safe and adequate staffinglevels of registered nurses  establishment of national  state  and local health policy boards consisting of health consumers and providers to oversee and evaluate the performance of the system  ensure access to care  and help determine research priorities  and establishment of a national health trust fund that would channel all current federal payments for health care programs directly into the fund  in addition to employees health premium payments 
 aids   hiv the green party calls for comprehensive  humane  and competent care of all people with hiv aids 
 the aids epidemic has not had adequate public health management at all government levels 
 drug corporations have a strong profit motive to encourage for medical management of those with hiv by using medication that keeps the virus from being detected in the blood 
 this means there are guaranteed sales of very expensive drugs 
 rather than invest in research for a cure like they have done with hepatitis c  the drug companies invest in drugs that manage a chronic illness 
 the green party believes that this failure to invest in research for a cure is because mainstream society has the belief that contracting hiv is self inflicted by  sinful  or  illegal  behavior 
 the largest groups with hiv aids in the usa are men who have sex with men  including gay  bisexual  and trans men  and men of color  particularly of african and latinx descent 
 persons who share needles are the next largest group of persons with hiv aids in the usa 
 while hiv drug treatment regimens have saved lives  some people suffer from debilitating side effects where quality of life is poor 
 there is also the economic side effect due to the high cost of these life saving medications 
 we recommend the following actions  increased public education in transmission prevention which includes funding for the purchase and distribution of condoms  gloves  dams  and needles   syringes 
 increased funding for age appropriate comprehensive sex education that includes use of barriers for prevention of fluid blood transmission 
 we support students having easy access to condoms  gloves  and dams in schools 
 increased funding for research focusing on a cure in addition to chronic disease management 
 creation of a repository for the latest peer reviewed theories  studies  and findings  and to facilitate sharing among research laboratories  schools and universities  medical centers  and public health facilities that would be accessible for common good rather than kept proprietary for profit 
 funding for methods of peer education for sex workers and those who may share needles  and to supply them with condoms  dams  gloves  and needles   syringes 
 educating incarcerated individuals in hiv transmission prevention and supplying them with condoms  dams  and gloves 
 additionally  remove barriers to access of medicines for incarcerated individuals with hiv aids  and hepatitis c 
 increased funding for educating the public about addiction and funding for treatment facilities for addicts  and for transitional housing to help with society re entry 
 education and funding for addiction harm reduction practices  including available needle exchange programs for those individuals with substance use problems who are not yet ready to enter treatment programs 
 immediate increases in funding for programs that ensure all individuals with hiv aids who want housing or treatment are able to obtain such promptly 
 no individuals with hiv should ever spend a single night on the streets or be turned away from treatment due to their economic status 
 we advocate for creating daily hiv medication distribution centers for individuals who are unable to manage the complex daily medication regimen without assistance 
 increased funding for free  anonymous testing of people for the presence of hiv aids 
 full funding to ensure broad access to pre exposure prophylaxis  prep  programs  which have been proven by researchers to minimize transmission of hiv and reduce public health costs by preventing the need for expensive  lifelong hiv treatment regimens 
 the green party calls for our governments to make every effort to negotiate fair and reasonable prices for associated drugs  rather than allowing manufacturers to extract excessive profits from these life saving medications 
 funding for outreach and treatment to address the particular circumstances and specific needs of the various communities affected by hiv aids 
 more research into better methods of prevention of hiv infection 
 while we support condom use  better condoms are also required 
 we support more vaccine research as well as research on prevention methods such as microbicides 
 people must be provided the means and support to protect themselves from all sexually transmitted and blood   body fluid borne diseases 
 a repeal of all hiv criminalization laws and policies and release all prisoners imprisoned solely due to hiv status 
 restore full federal health funding for persons living with hiv 
 labor the right to organize unions  bargain freely and strike when necessary is being destroyed by employers and their representatives in government 
 today  nearly one out of ten workers involved in union organizing drives is illegally fired by employers who wage a campaign of fear  threats  and slick propaganda to keep workers from exercising a genuinely free choice 
 and as union membership falls  so do the wages of all working people  union and non union alike 
 we support efforts to overcome these legal handicaps  especially in the south and southwest where the laws are most hostile 
 we also must dedicate ourselves to fighting for a complete overhaul of this countrys labor laws 
 the green party supports the irreducible right of working people  without hindrance  to form a union and to bargain collectively with their employer 
 this right was guaranteed under the national labor relations act of      
 we support the right of workers  without penalty  to inform other workers on the premises of a union being formed 
 it is imperative that employees enjoy workplace democracy  which includes the following  the right to elect representatives to sit equally with management on the board of directors 
 the right to fair and democratic elections of their own union officers 
 flexible working schedules so employees can arrange their own time to deal with personal and family concerns 
 all workers  temporary or permanent  employee or contractor  must be paid a living wage suitable for a single income  working full time       hours per week  see chapter iv  section h   of this platform for more information  
 the federal minimum wage for all workers should be indexed to inflation and adjusted regularly to ensure all workers nationwide continue to receive a living wage 
 to ensure a livable income for all people  we support additional measures such as implementing a universal basic income  see chapter iv  section d   of this platform for more information  
 all workers must have health care coverage  at least half paid by employer  until the passage of universal health care 
 all workers must have unemployment insurance  workers compensation  and access to a jobs search program when they are unemployed 
 minimum pensions for all workers  fully vested and portable  that do not reduce social security benefits 
 mediation as the first available solution to labormanagement disputes  with an agreed upon time limit 
 new union members right to submit a first contract to binding arbitration at the request of the union 
 labors first right to buy out a company that is for sale or is going bankrupt  or being outsourced to another state or another country 
 requiring employers who purchase or merge with other companies to honor all existing collective bargaining agreements and contracts 
 labors right to stock ownership and oversight of the investment of its own funds in the company where it works 
 we support the enactment of living wage laws that apply to all workers 
 a major consequence of this law will be the lessening of the ever widening gap between ceos income and workers pay 
 agricultural and other excluded workers must be covered by federal labor laws  except where existing state laws offer more protection 
 we encourage cooperative ownership and management of enterprises 
 we support day care service offered at every workplace when feasible  or reasonably near by when not feasible at the workplace 
 managements ability to close its workplace and move to a lower pay locale must be circumscribed to the degree that it protects the local workforce and their job security 
 we support the establishment of a   day work week with no cut in pay and at least one month of paid vacation per year for all workers 
 employees  including employees of contractors  whose work responsibilities can be fulfilled from a home office  or other location external to the employers premises  should not be required to commute to the employers premises if they choose to work off site 
 labor regulations should prohibit employers from penalizing workers who choose to work off site 
 this reform would encourage telecommuting and relieve urban traffic congestion  with a resulting reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
 employees who choose to commute to the office would continue to be allowed to do so 
 the ever widening gap between rich and poor is destructive of democracy and creates an uneven playing field for economic opportunity 
 public welfare that depends on hand outs from the corporate rich reduces democracy by that same amount 
 every citizen must have the leverage necessary to become a productive member of the economy and the society in which we live 
 all workers have a right to a safe and humane working environment 
 a lack of adequate enforcement of occupational safety and health administration  osha  laws and or insufficient standards put many workers at risk 
 we support the following safety policies  protect and enforce osha laws 
 we insist on adequate testing of equipment and funding of enforcement procedures 
 employers have a responsibility to protect workers from those hazards 
 legislate full funding for worker safety programs at both the state and federal levels 
 insist on agricultural practices that dont endanger farm workers 
 put agricultural practices under the jurisdiction of osha 
 we stand firmly opposed to privatization and contracting out of public services 
 a government that works for us would provide critical goods and services that should not be run for profit 
 criminal justice our position reduce the prison population  invest in rehabilitation  and end the failed war on drugs 
 the united states has the highest incarceration and recidivism rates of industrialized countries  while our nations criminal justice system in general is too often inhumane  ineffective  and prohibitively expensive 
 with less than five percent of the worlds population  the united states locks up nearly a quarter of the worlds prisoners 
 our law enforcement priorities place too much emphasis on drug related and petty  non violent crimes  and not enough on prosecution of corporate  white collar  and environmental crime 
 the majority of prisoners are serving terms for non violent  minor property and drug addiction crimes  or violations of their conditions of parole or probation  while the poor  the under educated and various racial and ethnic minorities are over represented in the prison population 
 the negative effects of imprisonment are far reaching 
 prisoners are isolated from their communities and often denied contact with the free world and the media 
 access to educational and legal materials is in decline 
 prison administrators wield total authority over their environments  diminishing procedural input from experts and censoring employee complaints 
 our priorities must include efforts to prevent violent crime and address the legitimate needs of victims  while addressing the socio economic root causes of crime and practicing policies that prevent recidivism 
 greens oppose the increasingly widespread privatization of prisons 
 these prisons treat people as their product and provide far worse service than government run prisons 
 profits in privately run prisons are derived from understaffing  which severely reduces the acceptable care of inmates 
 greens believe that greater  not lesser public input  oversight and control of prisons is the answer 
 greens call for an end to the  war on drugs   legalization of drugs and for treating drug abuse as a health issue 
 the  war on drugs  has been an ill conceived program that has wasted billions of dollars misdirecting law enforcement resources away from apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals  while crowding our prisons with non violent drug offenders and disproportionately criminalizing youth of color 
 greens also call attention to the fact that more than forty percent of those   
  million locked down come from americas black one eighth 
 the green party recognizes that our nations ostensibly color blind systems of law enforcement and crime control  from police practices to prosecutorial prerogatives  to mandatory sentencing and zero tolerance have effectively constituted an ubiquitous national policy of racially selective mass incarceration  a successor to jim crow as a means of social control  a policy that must be publicly discussed  widely recognized  and ultimately reversed 
 the nearly universal  though largely unspoken nature of this policy makes piecemeal reforms not accompanied by public discussion of the larger policy ineffective outside the context of a broad social movement 
 alternatives to incarceration encourage and support positive approaches to punishment that build hope  responsibility and a sense of belonging 
 prisons should be the sentence of last resort  reserved for violent criminals 
 those convicted of non violent offenses should be handled by alternative  community based programs including halfway houses  work furlough  community service  electronic monitoring  restitution  and rehabilitation programs 
 treat substance abuse as a medical problem  not a criminal problem 
 free all non violent incarcerated prisoners of the drug war 
 provide treatment to parolees and probationers who fail a drug test instead of re incarceration 
 release prisoners with diagnosed mental disorders to secure mental health treatment centers 
 ensure psychological and medical care and rehabilitation services for mentally ill prisoners 
 release prisoners who are too old and or infirm to pose a threat to society to less expensive  community based facilities 
 make reduction of recidivism a primary goal of parole 
 treat parole as a time of reintegration into the community  not as a continuation of sentence 
 provide community reentry programs for inmates before their release 
 provide access to education  addiction and psychological treatment  job training  work and housing upon their release 
 provide counseling and other services to the members of a parolees family  to help them with the changes caused by the parolees return 
 prevent unwarranted search without reasonable cause to parolees and their homes 
 increase funding for rape and domestic violence prevention and education programs 
 house violent and non violent juvenile offenders separately 
 continue the education of juveniles while in custody 
 substantially decrease the number of juveniles assigned to each judge and caseworker to oversee each juveniles placement and progress in the juvenile justice system 
 prison conditions  prisoner treatment and parolees ensure prison conditions are humane and sanitary  including but are limited to heat  light  exercise  clothing  nutrition  libraries  possessions  and personal safety 
 ensure availability of psychological  drug  and medical treatment  including access to condoms and uninterrupted access to all prescribed medication 
 minimize isolation of prisoners from staff and one another only as needed for safety 
 make incarceration more community based  including through increased visitor access by families 
 establish and enforce prison policies that discourage racism  sexism  homophobia and rape 
 require that each state prison system install a rehabilitation administrator with equal authority as the highest authority 
 ensure that all prisoners have the opportunity to obtain a general education diploma  i 
 high school equivalency diploma  and higher education 
 education has proven to reduce recidivism by     
 ensure the first amendment rights of prisoners  including the right to communicate with journalists  write letters  publish their own writings  and become legal experts on their own cases 
 provide incarcerated individuals the right to vote by absentee ballot in the district of their domicile  and the right to vote during parole 
 restore the right to hold public office to felons who have completed their prison sentence 
 conduct racial and ethnic disparity impact studies for new and existing categories of offenses 
 criminal justice reform abolish the death penalty 
 establish and fund programs to strengthen self help and community action through neighborhood centers that provide legal aid  alternative dispute resolution practices  mediated restitution  community team policing  and access to local crisis assault care shelters 
 establish elected or appointed independent civilian re view boards with subpoena power to investigate complaints about prison guard and community police behavior 
 sharply restrict police use of weapons and restraining techniques such as pepper spray  stun belts  tasers and choke holds 
 prohibit property forfeiture and denial of due process for unconvicted suspects 
 establish freedom on bail as a right of all defendants charged with non violent crimes 
 incorporate mental health and social services in bail agreements 
 increase compensation for jurors and provide childcare for those serving jury duty 
 ensure the opportunity for victims to make victim impact statements 
 thoughtful  carefully considered gun control such as is contained in the brady bill        
 eliminate the gun show loophole that permits sale of weapons without background checks 
 extend background checks to all private sales of firearms 
 end the war on drugs end the  war on drugs 
  redirect funds presently budgeted for the  war on drugs  toward expanded research  education  counseling and treatment 
 amend the controlled substances act to reflect that drug use in itself is not a crime  and that persons living in the united states arrested for using drugs should not be incarcerated with those who have committed victim oriented crimes 
 legalize possession  sale  and cultivation of cannabis marijuana 
 strike from the record prior felony convictions for marijuana possession  sale  or cultivation 
 grant amnesty and release from confinement without any further parole or probation  those who have been incarcerated for the use  sale  or cultivation of marijuana in federal and state prisons and in county city jails  and who otherwise are without convictions for victim oriented crimes  or who do not require treatment for abuse of hard drugs 
 provide the option for drug treatment to those leaving confinement 
 implement a step by step program to decriminalize all drugs in the united states 
 legalize psilocybin mushrooms and other entheogenic substances that have been found to have therapeutic benefits and low medical risks for responsible adult users 
 police accountability due to current conditions when it comes to policing the cities and people  police officers are the  th leading cause of death for young men in america 
 more commonly  the greatest lives that are at stake are those of our black  brown  lgbtqia   and disabled  including those with mental health issues when it comes to crimes against persons at the hands of the police 
 in accordance we recommend the following actions  police require all police officers to carry professional liability insurance as a requirement to working on the police force 
 that the insurance will act as a mechanism by which we can have officers with histories of brutality and misconduct removed from duty  thereby keeping that person from committing crimes under the protection of the police department  this functions through the insurance company  which will increase premiums and eventually determine that rogue officers are uninsurable 
 serve as a deterrent to officers taking actions that could result in a complaint against them  as this could cause a premium increase for the officer 
 prevent the taxpayer from having to foot the bill for police brutality cases  which cost taxpayers millions of dollars 
 establish a national database to record excessive force complaints  to be used in hiring decisions of police officers 
 establish community control of police through elected local police oversight boards with subpoena power to investigate complaints about police behavior and hold offending officers accountable 
 these boards will be empowered to hire and fire police officers and chiefs 
 population humans have a unique responsibility for stewardship of the earth 
 no species  especially on the upper end of the food chain  can have unchecked exponential growth without depleting the earths carrying capacity human population expands at the expense of other species 
 limiting the discussion to population numbers and birthrates diverts attention from over consumption in the industrial world and historic patterns of exploitation of developing countries 
 consumption oriented lifestyles that have evolved in the industrial world have resulted in a minority of people consuming a majority of resources 
 this is as significant a threat to the earths carrying capacity as the high birth rates in low consumption countries 
 current global demographics demonstrate that economic wellbeing promotes low birthrates 
 any discussion of population must also be a discussion of women throughout the world 
 there is documented evidence that the economic and social status of women is a primary factor in birthrates when women have control over their lives  birthrates decrease 
 also  a major barrier to the improvement of womens reproductive health is a lack of shared responsibility between men and women in family planning 
 a combination of male attitudes and cultural traditions have resulted in most men being under educated and uninvolved in the planning of their families 
 globally  human population is increasing while food production has leveled off 
 when population increases faster than the economy grows  the disparity between rich and poor also increases 
 higher human consumption rates and populations increase the pressure on the environment in every ecological problem area 
 those living in the industrialized world must end the habits of waste and over consumption that place as much stress on the environment as does population growth in developing nations 
 we must remove the political and economic barriers that prevent women around the world from having all the resources necessary to become skilled family planners 
 funds must be allocated for expanded scientific research into safer and more effective birth control techniques and devices 
 we demand better than adequate health care for women and children especially prenatal care 
 womens rights in this chapter  there must be access to free birth control devices  information counseling  and clinics to all who desire them 
 we call for implementation of family planning education for both genders in all levels of the state school system 
 womens rights in this chapter  we must promote new traditions and images of men becoming fully involved in all aspects of the family planning process j 
 housing and homelessness people have a right to a home and to be secure in their tenancy 
 however the supply of affordable housing is not meeting the need  while in an era of increasing deregulation  many tenants are losing important legal protections 
 instead of enacting zoning laws to increase affordable housing  the trend has too often been to increase the proportion of land zoned for commercial property at the expense of residential property 
 instead of providing funding to increase affordable housing  amount of funds dedicated to this purpose is decreasing 
 at the same time  rent control and tenant eviction protections do not exist in most jurisdictions  and where they do  they are often inadequate and under attack 
 state governments continue to weaken or preempt local rent control laws  while landlords who violate housing code requirements by failing to keep their property in habitable condition  are often tolerated or given lenient penalties 
 housing discrimination also remains rampant against people of color  immigrants  disabled  single people  gays and lesbians  and families with children 
 compounding these concerns is the long term stagnation of workers real wages  which further exacerbates the housing availability and affordability crisis 
 at the same time those who are not housed for example  the homeless are often hounded  threatened  and often cannot obtain badly needed services 
 while increased affordable housing can help alleviate the problem of homelessness  the homeless have additional needs that go far beyond housing 
 the green party recommends the following actions  renters tenants rights guarantee tenants rights  including  freedom from harassment and evictions without just cause  well enforced habitability standards  strong anti discrimination enforcement  including family protection laws and domestic partnerships  continuation of established services and amenities  the right to reasonable guest visitation  maintenance of roommate privileges  and the right to communicate with other tenants about conditions or circumstances in their buildings 
 enact and enforce strong penalties for landlords who violate these rights 
 fund public and non profit tenant related counseling and legal assistance for renters 
 rent control defend and expand cities right to enact local rent control laws  including vacancy control recontrol  that fit the needs of their communities 
 provide for publicly elected rent control stabilization boards for communities with local rent control laws 
 preserve and increase affordable housing supply defend and expand cities ability to enact affordable housing inclusionary ordinances that fit the needs of their communities  so that the private sector will contribute its share of affordable housing construction 
 provide funding for publicly built affordable housing  including funding for non profit corporations that build affordable housing 
 enact zoning to promote mixed use development along transit corridors to locate housing next to jobs and public transportation 
 lower parking requirements for new multi family development to lower cost of construction to enable greater affordability 
 regulate and limit the legal conversion of existing affordable housing into hotels  motels and short term vacation rentals and establish and enforce laws to prevent illegal conversions 
 fair housing enforce and strengthen the federal fair housing act and other federal and state fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination based on race  color  religion  gender  sexual orientation  disability  familial status and national origin 
 increase funding to assist people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination and support and fund fair housing enforcement and education across the nation 
 consider establishment of an independent fair housing enforcement agency outside of the u 
 department of housing and urban development in order to improve enforcement and restore public confidence in the implementation of federal fair housing policies 
 require that communities that receive federal housing funds provide evidence that their housing policies are affirmatively furthering fair housing 
 amend the federal section   housing choice voucher program to increase access of eligible families to high opportunity communities  by including higher rents where necessary  improving administrative portability of vouchers across jurisdictional lines  re establishing housing mobility programs to assist voucher holders seeking to move to higher opportunity areas  creating strong incentives and performance goals for administering agencies  and providing incentives to recruit new landlords into the program 
 amend the low income housing tax credit program to include fair housing requirements for site selection  affirmative marketing  and reporting of racial  ethnic data to ensure that this program works to further fair housing goals 
 ensure that fair housing principles are emphasized in programs addressing the mortgage and financial crisis 
 revive the presidents fair housing council to coordinate federal activities across agencies to support fair housing 
 measures to address homelessness prevent homelessness before it occurs by addressing its structural causes  through raising the income floor under the working poor  creating living wage jobs  providing job training and education that will enable low wage workers to obtain living wage jobs  preserving and expanding affordable housing  providing affordable health care  ensuring sufficient mental health care and substance abuse services  availability of healthy food and providing effective  holistic assistance that connects vulnerable individuals with sources of income and essential services 
 recognize that there are multiple  related and individualized causes of homelessness  and develop solutions that address them 
 maintain and expand the social services necessary to address the varied aspects of homelessness 
 move people rapidly into stable living arrangements  where they will not be under constant threat of displacement or worrying about untreated health problems or other personal difficulties 
 support and encourage service integration at all levels and move beyond the shelter approach to provide supportive housing that combines accommodation and an array of necessary services  to transition people out of homelessness 
 responding creatively to provide additional transitional housing through master leasing of private apartment blocks  purchase for profit single room occupancy hotels  and where feasible  conversion of short term emergency shelter facilities into permanent supportive housing 
 provide the resources necessary to advocate  develop and monitor discharge practices of local hospitals  jails and foster care through a zero tolerance policy for discharging people to the streets 
 set aside a share of public sector jobs for homeless people who are able to work 
 ensure that public agencies devoted to job creation are active in providing job training and work opportunities for homeless residents 
 ensure that public assistance is enough to allow recipients to afford a roof over their head 
 help homeless who are entitled to federal social security benefits and veterans disability payments to obtain them 
 involve homeless people in decision making about short  and long term solutions to homelessness 
 educate homeless people about their right to vote 
 encourage voter registration and voter participation among homeless people 
 do you like this page  tweet agriculture and food systems chemicalized and industrialized corporate agribusiness is driving family farmers off the land  rural america into depression  and ecosystems to collapse while failing to end hunger and malnutrition

 there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties  each arranged under its leader  and concerting measures in opposition to each other 
 this  in my humble apprehension  is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution 
  john adams foreign policy and demilitarization the bipartisan endless war machine enriches military contractors  lobbyists  and politicians  while it fuels devastation around the world and impoverishes our own people 
 the pentagon budget consumes over half of the discretionary federal budget  and real us military spending is over    trillion dollars per year 
 the military industrial complex  aided by its accomplices in both war parties  media  intelligence agencies  and beyond  has become a global empire that is profoundly destructive around the world and here at home 
 everyone has a human right to live in peace and dignity  free from violence and oppression 
 we must end the endless wars and create a new foreign policy based on diplomacy  international law  and human rights to lead the way to a new era of peace and cooperation

 healthcare our healthcare system is in crisis 
 the united states spends more on healthcare than any other high income country but has worse health outcomes  including the lowest life expectancy at birth and the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases 
    million people were uninsured in the us in      
 many of those who are insured still cant afford healthcare due to huge out of pocket costs 
 researchers estimate this lack of adequate healthcare led to over         excess deaths from covid    
 the wall street parties are funded by the insurance industry  the pharmaceutical industry  and other big healthcare profiteers to perpetuate this failed system that puts profits over people 
 we need a universal healthcare system that is equitable  comprehensive  free at point of service  and accessible to every single person in the us 
 a jill stein administration will  immediately implement national improved medicare for all as a precursor to establishing a uk style national healthcare service which will replace private hospital  private medical practice  and private medical insurance with a publicly owned  democratically controlled healthcare service that will guarantee healthcare as a human right to everyone in the united states cancel all medical debt advance reproductive rights and codify roe v

 mahatma gandhi housing there is a housing crisis across the united states 
 over         people were experiencing homelessness in       a record high 
 rental and housing costs have skyrocketed in recent years 
 corporations are buying up land and housing  while developers prioritize luxury housing unaffordable to most people 
 the wall street parties and the developers that fund them have completely failed to meet our housing needs 
 we need to end homelessness  support tenants and homebuyers  and massively invest in public housing to provide high quality  affordable homes for all 
 a jill stein administration will  end homelessness and housing insecurity with a homes guarantee nationally adopt housing first practices fund social housing as part of the real green new deal to build at least    million green  union built  publicly owned homes over the next    years support a universal tenants bill of rights direct the department of labor to assist with the establishment of a national tenants union implement universal rent control and a prohibition on excessive rental deposits eliminate credit checks from rental applications impose taxes on unoccupied homes  vacancy tax  and investment rental homestay properties to curb speculation expand house choice initiatives  and provide full funding to all existing project based rental assistance contracts repeal the faircloth amendment so that the department of housing and urban development  hud  can build public housing again prohibit predatory lending  require clearly listed mortgage costs and risks  and no fine print expand hud and us department of agriculture  usda  rural development programs for first time home buyers  with down payment assistance  direct guaranteed loans  and pre purchase housing counseling reinvigorate federal housing programs that build publicly owned housing for families  for the elderly  and for people with disabilities expand and protect the homeowner mortgage interest benefit  and eliminate the second home and yacht loopholes immigration immigrants rights are human rights 
 for hundreds of years immigrants have contributed immensely to the united states despite facing constant exploitation  discrimination  xenophobia and scapegoating 
 for decades  us foreign policies of war  intervention  and the war on drugs have driven many immigrants to leave their homes under duress to arrive here in dire need 
 the wall street parties and their wealthy backers use immigrants as essential labor  while denying them the human rights and dignity that everyone deserves 
 its time to completely overhaul this broken and abusive immigration system  as well as the unjust policies driving people to leave their homes 
 we need a comprehensive immigration policy and properly funded institutions to ensure a timely  ethical  transparent  and dignified path to citizenship for immigrants  asylum seekers  and refugees 
 border policy should move away from detention and enforcement response toward humane and effective asylum processing 
 this includes full support and funding for coordinated civil society response including social and legal service providers 
 instead of jailing migrants and asylum seekers  we will create non custodial  humanitarian reception centers at the border 
 migrants should be processed rapidly to screen for significant criminal records 
 once processed  migrants should have papers to begin work immediately  making them an invaluable resource for communities 
 a jill stein administration will  vastly reduce the tide of migration by ending the crises driving people to migrate in the first place   ending us wars and military interventions      in the past    years  per the congressional research service   reducing climate migration through an emergency green new deal and eliminating fossil fuel emissions within a decade  ending us economic sanctions driving migration from cuba  venezuela and nicaragua  legalizing marijuana in the us and supporting legalization in latin america to undercut drug cartels whose violence is a major driver of migration

 intervention end us sanctions in general  which are illegal in any event 
 they should most immediately be ended where they devastate economies in latin america and fuel immigration  as in cuba and venezuela end the war on drugs take immediate action to locate separated children and reunite them with their families direct the department of homeland security  dhs  and provide them resources to adjudicate visa petitions within    days  instead of the current   years or more  to shorten the duration of family separation for legal immigrants and citizens fully staff and fund immigration courts hire more asylum officers and provide exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate asylum cases ensure all immigration judges have civil service protection ensure that due process and constitutional protections are available to undocumented immigrants when it comes to deportation issues repeal section     a     b  ii  of the immigration and nationality act concerning accruing unlawful presence support daca by updating the registration date of the      registry act to           and restoring section     i  of the immigration and nationality act  which expired in april

 for    years  real wages have stagnated while worker productivity and corporate profits have soared 
 inflation fueled by corporate profiteering has driven up the cost of living  eating away at the modest wage gains working people have won 
 we need a government that works for working people  not elite wealthy donors 
 its time to restore and expand workers rights  support unions  cooperatives and worker ownership  and ensure that working people enjoy the full fruits of their labor

  louis brandeis prisons and policing we call the united states the land of the free but we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world  with over   
  million people in federal  state  and local prisons and jails 
 instead of addressing root causes of inequality and injustice  todays systems of policing  prisons  and criminal justice have been designed by the wall street parties and their wealthy elite backers to enforce a socioeconomic hierarchy that is systemically racist and classist 
 we need to end mass incarceration  police brutality  and systemic injustice 
 a jill stein administration will guarantee as a human right a restorative criminal justice system that treats every one of the over

 reparations is a cornerstone of the black agenda  but reparations is far from the only policy needed to begin to redress what has been stolen from the black community over      years 
 scholars and activists who have studied and formulated propositions for reparations itself have put the minimum cash value of reparations at     trillion  to be paid to those who claim legitimate descendancy from enslaved blacks prior to the civil war 
 this number is derived not only from the stolen labor prior to       but also from the reneged promise of field order     commonly referred to as    acres and a mule  which was never made good upon 
 we dont need any further debate on whether reparations should be paid 
 they should  without question  as they were in      to those impacted by wwii japanese internment camps 
 the stein administration will confer with black community leaders on who qualifies  how they qualify  historical records exist   how much they will be paid in cash  and how those payments will be made 
 there are other policies essential to the overall black agenda  as slavery was not the only historic crime against the black community in america 
 we recognize both historic and existing racism in america  while it has been addressed in legislation such as the civil rights act of       to this day an end to systemic racism has never been realized 
 many of these essential policies  such as universal healthcare  immigration  policing  and free public college education  are addressed in other areas of this platform 
 furthermore  it should be noted that the black agenda is a progressive agenda 
 in addition to ensuring reparations  a jill stein administration will  direct all federal agencies to consider and include race and ethnicity as part of all of their initiatives and other programs implemented with federal dollars overturn the harmful alexander v 
 sandoval supreme court decision that currently increases the burden for  or eliminates private right of action against entities that violate title vi and other mandates contained in the civil rights act of      promulgate a moratorium on all proposed cop cities and end federal investments in such facilities establish a national office for civilian oversight committees to ensure greater transparency and accountability for civilian law enforcement departments establish a multi agency federal returning citizens task force to assist and provide resources for the formerly incarcerated in an effort to expedite their journey back to full citizen status including  but not limited to  immediate restoration of voting rights in most cases increase investment in historically black colleges and universities  hbcus  and leverage the power of the federal government to force states to compensate state run  land grant hbcus the more than     billion they are owed increase investments in programs that support black owned businesses 
 ensure that a universal single payer healthcare system addresses and resolves the health outcome disparities for the black community  and in particular for black women eliminate food deserts where fresh produce and food sovereignty is largely unavailable  a condition which disproportionately impacts black communities 
 work with congress and federal agencies to codify the justice for black farmers act eliminate white nationalists from police forces by federal law  and ensure white nationalist groups activities are routinely monitored  due to white nationalist violence being the greatest single source of domestic terrorism 
 ensure the office of civil rights is fully funded  staffed  and fulfills its obligation to protect the civil rights of marginalized communities 
 restore section   b  and section   of the      voting rights act and permanently certify the entire law address and ameliorate the legacy of redlining through programs that deliver recompense for black homeowners whose home values are adversely and disproportionately impacted to this day by this systemically racist practice federal moratorium on new construction of fossil fuel infrastructure and other polluting operations in or proximate to black and other environmental justice communities massive reinvestment from policing and prisons into social  economic  and other programs that lead to direct community benefits establish a federal commission to eradicate the lead pipes and tainted water crisis impacting cities like flint  mi within one year after i take office work with congress and impacted community members to draft and pass the justice for cancer alley act that will include compensation and free healthcare in perpetuity for victims in this region who have been subjected to environmentally racist practices for decades coordinate with black led formations including  but not limited to  the black hive at movement for black lives to codify proposals and demands included in their black climate mandate coordinate with black led formations including  but not limited to  the black alliance for peace to promulgate their zone of peace strategies that combat and dismantle larger structures and interests that generate war and state violencecolonialism  patriarchy  capitalism and all forms of imperialism both domestically and internationally nobodys free until everybodys free

 for instance  the nonbinding green new deal does not call for a ban on fracking or a prohibition of new fossil fuel infrastructure 
 moreover  the inadequacy of the nonbinding green new deal to address climate and ecological crisis is further demonstrated by the following  extends the timeline for zero emissions by       years to      redefines zero emissions to net zero to enable the continued burning of fossil fuels with false climate solutions like carbon capture and sequestration and direct air capture replaces tenet of democratic public ownership and planning in the energy  transportation  manufacturing  and housing sectors with unreliable market based incentives featuring public subsidies for private corporations does not stipulate the phase out of nuclear power   a scam which is dirty  dangerous  unaffordable  uninsurable and has no solution to the problem of toxic nuclear waste no mention of the need for deep cuts in military spending and operations to help pay for the green new deal and slash emissions in the process in short  we need the economic democracy of an ecosocialist real green new deal to plan and coordinate the complicated transition to      clean energy and zero emissions on the rapid timescale required to save our climate 
 an ecosocialist approach is also necessary to fairly compensate and center people   primarily  black  indigenous  and the poor  who were systematically excluded from the original new deal   as well as redress the lasting impacts of profoundly racist policies that derived from it including  but not limited to  redlining   which acted as a catalyst for the legacy of environmental racism
