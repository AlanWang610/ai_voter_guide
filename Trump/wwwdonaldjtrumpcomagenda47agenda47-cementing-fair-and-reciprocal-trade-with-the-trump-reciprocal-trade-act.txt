 Under the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, other countries will have two choices—they’ll get rid of their tariffs on us, or they will pay us hundreds of billions of dollars, and the United States will make an absolute FORTUNE. There will be no more unilateral economic surrender like we’ve done for many many decades.  
 This will especially help our great farmers in Iowa and other Agricultural states, and it will help our manufactures all across the nation. We will be knocking down barriers to American farm products, American dairy products, steel—just about everything you can think of. From all around the world they take advantage of us, but no more.
