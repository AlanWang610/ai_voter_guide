 “This great undertaking will also help restore hope and aspiration to America's young people, instead of being irrationally terrified by political predictions of climate apocalypse. Instead of toiling, for low wages or left-wing make-work projects, I have a vision that will give young Americans a chance to find real meaning and work once again, like we had it two and a half years ago, building the backbone of America that is powerful, prosperous, productive, vigorous, modern, independent, and free.”  
 As you know, China paid hundreds of billions of dollars to the United States when I was president. No other president got ten cents, check it out, not even ten cents. I will deploy a team of warrior lawyers to hunt down every unnecessary regulation in the federal registry that hampers domestic production.  
 And we will wipe them off the books. We will again get out of Paris. And we will rapidly issue approvals for all worthy energy infrastructure projects with a focus on maximum speed to bring prices down rapidly. So, get those proposals ready now, because we are going to put thousands of Americans to work building the power plants, pipelines, grids, ports, refineries, and shipping terminals of tomorrow. We are going to have very inexpensive energy again, like we did just two and a half years ago.
