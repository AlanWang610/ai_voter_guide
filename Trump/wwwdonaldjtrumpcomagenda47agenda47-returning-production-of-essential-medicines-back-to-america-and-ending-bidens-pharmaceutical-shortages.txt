 - The EO required federal agencies to “Buy American” by facilitating the domestic production of medicines and medical devices that the FDA determined “essential” to public health. It did so by requiring federal agencies to buy medicines and medical devices that are entirely “produced in the United States.”  
 - The EO also required the U.S. Trade Representative to modify our international trade agreements so that drugs deemed “essential” to public health by the FDA can no longer be purchased by federal agencies from any of the 120 countries that has a trade agreement with the U.S. that authorizes the manufacture of such “essential” drugs for the U.S. market.  
 - With federal agencies still permitted under current law to purchase medicines “essential” to public health from any of America’s 120 trading partners, there is no incentive for federal agencies to buy from domestic companies. As a result, the United States will continue to be dependent on foreign countries for its most critical medical needs.  
 There's currently a shortage of at least 14 critical cancer drugs in the United States. They just can't get it. And every month of delay, cancer treatment increases the risk of death by at least 10%. It's unthinkable that this could be happening in the United States of America in 2023. It is truly unbelievable. We are becoming a third world country very rapidly between our open borders and our bad elections. We are third world.
