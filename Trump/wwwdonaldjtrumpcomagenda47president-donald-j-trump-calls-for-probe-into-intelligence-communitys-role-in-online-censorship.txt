 In response to the stunning revelations from the "Twitter Files," President Donald J. Trump released a new video calling for an immediate investigation into the disturbing relationship between Big Tech platforms and government agencies, including the coordination of a massive censorship, surveillance, and propaganda campaign against the American people.  
 But the censorship of the Laptop from Hell is only the beginning of the story about the weaponization of government against free speech. We must have free speech in our country. We must have a fair and free press. As recent reporting shows, the FBI and other rogue agencies have been systematically colluding with former national security officials placed in high positions at Twitter, and very likely other companies, to advance their censorship regime, which is really in this case to steal an election.  
 The “Twitter Files” prove that we urgently need my plan to dismantle the illegal censorship regime — a regime like nobody’s ever seen in the history of our country or most other countries for that matter. To prosecute the perpetrators for their crimes, and to restore free speech for all Americans — so important. We need a free press, we need free speech, we need fair elections, and we need borders.  
 The revelations also highlight why my proposal to end the revolving door between the Deep State — and there is a Deep State indeed. I wasn’t a believer, but everybody’s a believer right now — and the tech tyrants is so important. There must be a 7-year cooling off period before any employee of these powerful agencies is allowed to take a job at a major platform.
