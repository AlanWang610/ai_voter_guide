 “As President, I took the most dramatic action of any administration to curtail China’s ability to conduct espionage in the United States,” President Trump said. “And when I’m back in the White House, those efforts will be expanded in a very, very big way. Instead of hunting down Republicans, a reformed FBI and Justice Department will be hunting down Chinese spies.”  
 When President Trump is back in the White House, he will kick Chinese intelligence operations out of the country and force China to give up any U.S. holdings that put national security at risk. A strong signal must be sent that America will not allow China to trample our sovereignty and illegally surveil our country.  
 The FBI even recently admitted that China operates a secret police force on American soil, how do you like that one, imposing the iron fist of the Communist Party, the rule —think of this, the Communist Party rule on Chinese nationals in the United States. Just think about that. We will shut that down—and we will shut it down cold. Thank you very much.
